            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               <hi>
                  <seg rend="decorInit">R</seg>EADER,</hi> I give thee here the ſecond part of the Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nister of State, which long ſince I promiſed thee, and Confeſs it unjuſt to make thee Languiſh ſo long in expecta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of ſo little a thing, and that thy good reception of the first parts deſerved better Expedition, and to ſupply that by Promptitude of Labour which Could not be paid by th' Excellency of the Work; but that which Cauſed the delay and ſuſpenſion of the performance of my promiſe, Was the Condition of the Time and the preſent State of <hi>Europe,</hi> Having propoſed unto myſelf not only to ſpeak of it, but to make it the Foundation and Baſis of my Reaſonings; In th' Execution of this Deſign many Impediments delayed me, as a perſon that had nothing, but Moveable duſt to build upon; And the frequent and unexpected Revolutions, which the War hath perpetually produced have often taken the proſpects from me, which I had taken, and made the Foot to ſlide, which was Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vanced towards my work. But to perform my promiſe at last, I have Leapt over theſe ill paces, and have stollen betwixt theſe Rocks, to gain the place, where I would Land, and where I was expected by the too favourable and too obliging deſires of many perſons; And I have made th' Ill fortune of the Times and the Condition of Affairs to be ſubſervient to my deſigns, and am entred upon a Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riere, the War hath laid open unto me with Conveniency, and which Peace will ſhut up at its Coming in by diſarming ſpirits of ſharpneſs, and in blunting the points of Pens as of Armes; I could have heartily deſired that th' Ambition of our Enemies, had been leſs Immoderate, and that th' Attempts and Invaſions they have made upon th' Eſtates and Liberties of our Allyes had not tyred the Kings Patience nor Constrained that Generous Prince to take into his Protection and ſecure by his Arms them, whom he could not defend by his Interceſſions, and good Endeavours; However, ſince the Lot is Cast, and that Juſtice hath drawn the Sword to revenge th' Injury which Reaſon nor Interceſſion could cauſe to be repaired, I thought, my courſe of life not permitting me to ſerve the King in his Armies, that I ought to ſerve him ſome other way, and that there are Means t' Incommodate his Enemies without uſing of Violence; That th' Houſe of <hi>Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtria</hi> being the great Adverſary the King hath in hand, reſolving to raiſe the Greatneſs of their Ambition upon two Engines, Force, and Artifice, and this last, though the most immaterial, removing ſometimes Burdens, and ſometimes overthrowing great Weights, which by force were Immo<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>eable; I did conceive, that I ſhould not perform a Small Act, if I could render it leſs profitable or leſs powerfull; And cure the ſpirits of other Princes, and the ſpirits of their Subjects, of the multitude of Errors wherewith that Houſe hath prepoſſeſſed them to its Advantage; And break the Chain that holds them Priſoners to the great prejudice of the Christian Common-Wealth. I believed, that the Kings good Genius, for that purpoſe might inſpire my Writings with the ſame Vertue and Succeſs, which heretofore th' Eloquent Diſcourſe of <hi>Sir</hi> of <hi>Langey</hi> had in changing the Belief and th' Inclinations of a part of <hi>Germany,</hi> when <hi>Charls</hi> the fifth had made ſuch Malignant Impreſſions against his Maſter, that with great Difficulty he obtained Audience of any perſon. We are not altogether
<pb facs="tcp:33686:4"/>in that Distreſs, and the Corruption of Reſentments, is not ſo general, as it was in that Countrey; There are nevertheleſs many Enchantments both there and in other places, and darkneſſes to diſſipate, which are favourable to th' Houſe of <hi>Auſtria,</hi> and this is my preſent Work, according to the Little Underſtanding God hath given me, and the little Knowledge gained in the Matters of the World; The manner of Aſſaulting this Houſe, (which I do otherwiſe <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="5 letters">

               </gap> to flye from all parts againſt the King and his Miniſters of State; But Imitation is not a valuable Excuſe for ill proceedings, and every ſort of Revenge is not decent for honest perſons. The praiſes I give, to the good Qualities of the Princes of that Houſe, and to the Commendable part in the form of their Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment, which I do not Conceal, make it ſufficiently appear, That nothing but the Truth and th' Intereſt of the publique have forced me to diſcover the Defects, which are of Importance for the publique to know, and whereof it were to be wiſht that theſe Princes were exempt for the peace of the World, and for their peculiar Acquieſcence. It were, I ſay to be wiſhed, that theſe Princes had not staid till other Princes had put bounds to their Ambition, and t' Attain their pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed Ends, had not made uſe of all ſorts of Means. That if they are notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding ill ſatisfied with me, and take an ill Conceit againſt my Book, I ſhall not think it ſtrange, knowing very well, that Wounds cannot be handled without gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving Pain, nor ſome Truths publiſhed without gaining of Hatred.</p>
            <p>As 'tis them with ſome Trouble, that I do undraw the Curtain, wherewith th' Houſe of <hi>Auſtria</hi> diſguiſeth their Defaults, and diſcover the Playſter, wherewith it hideth her Spots; I avow alſo, that 'tis with an unſpeakable Joy, that I have endeavoured to repreſent the Kings Conduct altogether contrary to theirs; That 'tis with an Incredible ſatisfaction, that I do render th' Homage, and pay the Tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bute to his Perſon, which are due of natural Right to his Excellent vertues; And that 'tis no ſmall Content to Conceive, that this Eſſay made for his ſervice proceeds rather from my Choyce and Zeal for his Glory, than from any preciſe Duty required by Subjection. Th' Actions of this Princes Life, are ſo many Wonders, on what ſide ſoever you regard them; And who can propoſe to himſelf a more agreeable object than that of his Reign, Where Vertue and Fortune ſeem to diſpute to Emulation for production of the faireſt Effects; for proviſion of the greateſt Recompences for the higheſt Merit; for the publiſhing of it to the moſt advantage; o whom th' honour of th' higheſt Enterprizes ſhall be given, and to whom ſhall be attributed the most happy and highest Events, This is not all; This Reign, which in its ſelf is ſo admirable, and from whoſe form Iſſues ſo ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny Lights, as are proper for it, receives yet a greater Luſtre and new Occaſions of Admiration from th' Oppoſition made to his Reign by our Neighbours, and by the Parallel of their Affairs with ours. I will not therefore enlarge or trouble myſelf to prove, what is not conteſted, and which in a ſhort time may be better known; when the Clouds the War of neceſſity Interpoſeth to our felicities are diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perſed, It will appear more Entire, and with that abundance of Bleſſings, which Peace ought to Crown it withall.</p>
            <p>The King next to God is the principal Spring, and the firſt Principle of the
<pb facs="tcp:33686:4"/>wonders we ſpeak of; 'Tis alſo to him, to whom I do attribute the firſt Honour and Principal Glory, Though much reflects upon them, who have been th' Inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of ſo proſperous a Reign; Who have ſeconded that Excellent Prince with their Counfels and Actions; Who have aided in ſteering th' helm of the State, and to guide the Ship to a glorious Haven. I would not deſcend to that particular, nor prepoſſeſſe the ſpirit of any preſon, I have not made diſtribution of that Glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, nor taken from the Reader, the right of giving it to whom he ſhall think wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thiest of it; I leave him then this privilege Entire, and the Liberty to make Judgement, as it ſhall ſeem good unto him; I have not offended against Juſtice, when I have made uſe of that right, or that the ſame faith and ſincerity have not alwayes reigned in what I have written for the paſt time, as in what I now write, and ſhall ſay for the future; And 'tis that little good, which you may find in my writings of this Nature, or at leaſt that, whereof I dare glory. For they do me much wrong, who have accuſed me to have Commended ſome perſons with Exceſs of praiſes, and with Immoderate complyance; That is very contrary to my humour, and I would have them know, that 'tis as impoſſible for me to praiſe falſly, as to blame cauſleſsly, and to ſe<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

I have written my Thoughts, the Words have iſſued from the ſoul; Painting hath not Contributed any thing to the ſubject, the ſoul repreſents; 'Tis a proceeding I will never forſake; And Fortune hath not hopes enough to give me, nor good enough to do me, t' oblige me to betray my Conceptions, and to tell a Lye, which is the greateſt of all faults. Poſterity will ſpeak with much more advantage than I have done of th' actions which I have praiſed; strangers applaud highly, what I have ſaid, and even they, who are affrighted, and whoſe eyes they dazle, make the ſame Judgment; if I have ſinned againſt the Rules of good ſenſe, and if my Reaſonings are found Weak, they ſhall very much oblige me in reforming them, and in inſtructing of me. 'Tis a courteſie not to be rejected, and a blind man ſhould be very unhappy in refuſing to be guided by a perſon that hath a good ſight. This ſecond part, and the third, which ſhall ſhortly fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low, will open a fairer field, and furniſh a more Ample matter of Inſtruction for them, who would do me that favour; I here they ſhall find more myſterious Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litiques and more profoundly handled, than in the firſt part, and there may be ſeen more Lively and more Natural touches of that Incomparable Conduct, which will not receive its true value but from the future, and from th' Age of the World.</p>
            <p>Thou wilt excuſe, <hi>Reader,</hi> this ſmall Apology, which ought not to be denied to Truth, the Chief and beſt Condition of my works; I come to the Subject of this Book, whereof the two firſt books have for Title and Matter, <hi>The Councel of War of a Prince;</hi> 'Tis not that I pretend there, t' expound the Precepts of the Military Art, or to ſhew th' Order of a Siege and of a Battel; ſuch things are not of my profeſſion or force; my deſign is onely to give ſome Notions and ſome Lights to them, who having th' honour to be of the Princes Councel, ought to be furniſhed, and able to give an Opinion upon the War, the moſt Jealous of all humane Actions, and the moſt important of all politique Affairs; 'Tis certain, that ſince a Man is not called to th' Exerciſe of Juſtice without Learning and Approved abilities; no perſon ought to riſe raſhly and without preparation to that ſevere and dreadfull Tribunal of Juſtice, which the Prince executes a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt himſelf, and ought t' exerciſe againſt other Princes; To that Tribunal,
<pb facs="tcp:33686:5"/>I ſay, where no perſon can adviſe a War without giving Sentence of Death a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt a great Number of Innocent perſons, who are obliged to periſh in the Juſt or Unjuſt Quarrels of their Maſters.</p>
            <p>I paſs from thence to the Third part, and there continue my Method, ſuppoſing that th' Armes of a Prince cannot have a juſter Imployment than to purge the State of Civil Wars; And to divert <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>hem, which forein Enemies Endeavour to bring into the Countrey; And having declared that the King hath ſtopt the great ſpring of the Troubles of the Kingdome in ſuppreſſing th' <hi>Hugonot</hi> fac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; I ſhew, That he hath diſappointed the great deſign of Monarchy of th' Houſe of <hi>Auſtria,</hi> in which was ſubtilly and neceſſarily laid up the Ruine of <hi>France.</hi> Theſe wonderfull Events, being conſidered, I conceive, that no man can ſay any thing of ſo great advantage of this Prince, that is not beneath his Glory, and that Rhetorique wants Figures, or th' Art of Sophisters boldneſs t' equal the greatneſs of theſe two Succeſſes; but ſince the Deſign of this pretended Monar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chy, which many perſons of old date have attributed to th' Houſe of <hi>Auſtria,</hi> paſſeth into the Spirits of ſome men for an Invention or Fable; I am reſolved, to draw this. Truth from the Darkneſs where it was hid, and to cleer the belief of Princes and of Nations, with the Lights that Hiſtory hath furniſht, and with the reſults from the Concluſions of the Deſigns and Enterprizes of the Princes of that Houſe, wherein I have endeavoured, to give them as much honour as is poſſible for me, in acting rationally and in order to the proportion and appropri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ation of the Means to th' Ends, they had deſigned. For the World well knows, that I have not been of <hi>Ferdinands</hi> Council nor of <hi>Charls</hi> the fifth, nor of the other Princes of that Line. I have yet, <hi>Reader,</hi> two or three things, to ſay, before I finiſh, and it concerns me that thou ſhouldſt know them. The firſt is, that in ſpeaking of the raiſing of the <hi>Catalans,</hi> and particularly of th' Inſurrections of the <hi>Portugeſes,</hi> which immediately followed, It ſeems, that I do preſage and play the Prophet of things paſt; To which I anſwer, It was foreſeen, that it might be objected unto me, and that I had not expoſed my ſelf to that Aſſault, if many perſons of great Quality and Merit, had not ſeen the ſame things in a diſcourſe, which I made from the beginning, and at th' Apparition of that Oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>currence, before the <hi>Portugeſes</hi> had thrown off the <hi>Spaniſh</hi> Domination; The ſecond thing is, That Foreiners may poſſibly take offence in that I do touch ſome Errors in the perſons of their Nation and diſcover ſome ſtaines. But I aſsure my ſelf, that they will be eaſily ſatisfied, when they Conſider, that 'tis not by a ſpirit of Diſdain or motion of Hatred, and that the manner of my Entertainment, is not different from that which I give my Countreymen, whoſe defects and ſtains, I do not hide or ſuppreſs, when the Truth and Neceſſity of the diſcourſe oblige me t' expoſe and produce them. The third thing is, that a falſe date is ſtollen into my Narratives, which is that, of the Treaty of <hi>Smalchalde</hi> and it may be of ſome other <hi>Anachroniſmes,</hi> which are of no Importance to my deſign; And that it ſatisfies me, that the facts whereon my Reaſonings are grounded and built are true, without reſpect to the time wherein they were done.</p>
            <p>Theſe Advices, <hi>Reader,</hi> being received, Thou maiſt give what Entertain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment thou pleaſeſt this Book; Whatever it be, it ſhall give me no Trouble; being certain, that no perſon can diſappoint me, of the first Recompenſe and Principal End, that I propoſed to my ſelf in writing, which is, the ſatisfaction of Endeavouring the ſervice of my Prince and Countrey.</p>

                  <p>
                     <seg rend="decorInit">A</seg>T th' Entry of this Diſcourſe, there's Matter of Aſtoniſhment; That Wars are ſeen amongſt Men; Rules invented, and an Art formed to direct them; That among all th' Arts exerciſed in the Society of Men, there's none that caſts ſo great a light, or that gains ſo great a por<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of glory. And that in th' Old Law, War is found to be ſo ſolemnly Authoriſed, and, in a manner, Conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crated, by the Command of God, as that amongſt his high and moſt glorious Titles, He hath choſen That of the <hi>God of Armies.</hi> Th' inclination which naturally the greateſt part of Things hath, not onely to Conſerve It's Beeing, but alſo to Multiply it, is evidently contrary to this Viſible folly which incites Men to the Deſtruction of one another; And we do not ſee, That other Creatures of the ſame kind, make amongſt themſelves particular aſſigned Combats, or that they aſſemble in Troops to decide any difference by Murder, and by the ſlaughter of the greateſt part of them. That Dereliction and
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:33686:6"/>Proſtitution men make of their Lives, and the Subjects for which they ſo willingly Sacrifize them, being many times but a little ſmoak and opinion; Are they not th' effects of a ſecret Inſtinct? That it is not their Chiefeſt good, nor their Ultimate felicity, which without doubt it ſhould be, if there were not a greater Good: And the Wars, which God permits or commands, where Life is given up as a prey to ſo many Accidents that deſtroy it, are they not Clear evidences, and a Manifeſt conviction, of the ſmall Account God makes of it, and that it is not the faireſt preſent he makes to men, nor the ſubject, wherein accompliſhed th' End for which he gives them their Beeing?</p>
                  <p>But not to wander out of our way, and to take off th' Amaze<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, whereof we have propoſed the Cauſes; I ſay, It muſt not be thought ſtrange, that men enter ſo often into Quarrels with their fellows, ſince they are ſo ſeldome at Accord with themſelves, and are ſcarce free from Troubles and Diſorders within, and that their very Souls are the Fields of the Combats that are fought, and th' Enemies that make the War quarter always within them. This diſorder, which happens in the condition of Men, and not of Beaſts, in whom no diſcords, ſeem t' ariſe, nor contrariety of parts to be formed, hath many ſprings from whence it iſſues; the firſt is, as all the world knows, the Conſtitution of their Nature, and the divers or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders of the parts that compoſe it; th' Inclinations of th' one are or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinarily oppoſed to th' inclinations of th' other, and their Appetites agitated with ſuch Contrary motions, that they which cauſe the Fire t' ariſe are not more oppoſed, than they that make the Earth to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcend. So that there is neither peace nor quietneſs in th' Interior of Man, longer than the Superior part is obeyed by the Paſſions, and that th' Appetite where they are formed, permits the yoke, and reſiſts not th' orders that are impoſed upon it.</p>
                  <p>If it happen, and 'tis the ſecond Spring of diſorders, That in theſe Inteſtine Wars and Skirmiſhes, which tear the Soul, th' Interior part obtains the Victory, yet Calm and Reſt attends not upon that fatal Conqueſt, but greater Emotions, and more dangerous Tempeſts are raiſed: And as there are People of ſo unquiet a Nature, and of a humor ſo turbulent, as that they can never remain in peace, and that of neceſſity they muſt ſtir within, when they have nothing to do without, and kindle Civil, when they have finiſhed Forein Wars: So when the Paſſions find no reſiſtance from Reaſon, and have neither Bridle to retain them, nor Barrier to ſtay them, they abate not of their Inquietude; they turn their Forces againſt themſelves; they trouble and hinder one another in the purſute of their Objects: Love flacks th' activity of Ambition; Avarice ſtops, the progreſs of Love; and th' poor Soul, the Subject which theſe Furies torment, and the Sea theſe Winds agitate, ſuffers more by their violence than can be expreſſed; yet Reaſon is never ſo fully obſcur'd, nor ſo generally diſarmed by the Paſſions, but that ſome beam always remains, which
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:33686:6"/>makes viſible to the Soul, at leaſt at certain encounters, the Defor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mity of her condition, and points out her ſhame and remorſe for baſe condeſcentions. I could here produce, if it were not a little from the purpoſe, though not unprofitable, another Cauſe of Man's miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fortune, who delivers himſelf up to the mercy of his Paſſions, and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mits them to take the place of his Reaſon, which ſhe ought to have over them: Man being unable to put of the Deſire of happineſs, which Nature hath planted in the Centre of his Soul, nor to forbear acting to its Content, though he intend it not; and incapable to fill or calm it, but in the poſſeſſion of that End for which he received his Being, as the cauſe it was given unto him, or in the exerciſe of the Virtues, the means of conducting him thither, having obtain'd th' other good things purſu'd, and enjoy'd th' other deſired objects, is to begin again, and is as empty as He was before; that inſtead of going ſtreight on, He turn'd the back to th' aſpir'd felicity; And no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing remains, if more were not to be fear'd, but a dull ſaciety that beſots him, a profound wearineſs of ſpirit that renders him inſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portable to himſelf, and ſuch an inevitable melancholy as gnaws and frets men who fall from their hopes.</p>
                  <p>As then, th' Irregular Paſſions are the cauſe of th' Inteſtine Trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles which men ſuffer, and of th' ill intelligence they hold within themſelves; they are alſo the cauſe of the Quarrels raiſed amongſt particular perſons; and of the Wars made amongſt Princes. Th' enterpriſes, which Ambition, Avarice, and the like diſordred moti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons forme in ſome, to the dammage of others, and th' oppoſitions made to their violence and rapidity, put all Civil Societies into com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buſtion, and cut aſunder all the Bonds of the Politique Body. It were to the loſs of my Expreſſions, and to th' abuſe of the Readers patience, to labor the confirmation of a truth, which Experience hath taught in all places, Reaſon cauſeth to be touched with the finger, and where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of Hiſtory gives conſtant evidences.</p>
                  <p>As to Beaſts, 'tis no wonder if they are not ſubject to ſo great ſtroaks, and to thoſe furious ſtorms, wherewith God hath per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted Man's conditition to be beaten; Their Souls are not divided by its Powers into oppoſite Regions, and make not in them the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>junction of two different worlds, the Spiritual and Temporal, as the Souls of Men do; but all it's Inclinations and Faculties are drawn, as the Philoſophers ſay, from the breaſt and power of the Matter; it hath no Appetite but what is bounded, and a ſmall thing ſatisfies it; and as Nature guides it by a true light to th' Objects moſt proper, and preſcribes the degree of Enjoyment that is moſt convenient, and can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not exceed; ſhe provides alſo objects in ſuch Abundance, and of ſo Eaſie an acquiſition, that all th' Individuals of the ſame kind find what is neceſſary for them, and without labour.</p>
                  <p>To divert theſe evils, wherewith th' Humane condition's afflicted, or to correct the malignity, and to dull th' edge of them, Divine Provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence hath not deprived the Soul of Means and convenient Remedies;
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:33686:7"/>if that had been, it had left too ſhameful and too viſible a ſtain up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on that fair <hi>Oeconomy,</hi> wherewith it governs the World; and that admirable congruity it hath obſerv'd in all th' other parts which com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe it, had been belied in the nobleſt part of them, It had acted with th' imprudence of an Artificer, who lays out all his force, and th' ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellency of his Art, upon a baſe ſubject, and takes pains to carve a piece of Glaſs curiouſly, and to commit great faults in a matter of much price, or to ſet a rich Diamond ill, which muſt abate the luſtre of his Art, and honor due to Nature. But that is prevented; for as to the principal good of men, as th' inward calm and traquillity of the Soul, and victory of Reaſon over the Paſſions, whence tranquil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity and calm do iſſue, the Means to obtain them, is in their power, and therein they depend not upon the fancies of Fortune, nor upon the Paſſions of other Men: Yet ſince th' Infidelity of <hi>Adam,</hi> and th' unhappy deſtiny of corrupted Nature, there are not onely great Combats to be fought, and ſtrange Difficulties to be overcome for that Victory; but alſo great Reliefs to be expected, and eminent ſupplies for Philoſophy, and greater from Religion; and the Grace of God is never wanting to them, who are not wanting to themſelves, and the good ſucceſſes of this War attend always upon good Deſigns, and lawful Reſiſtances.</p>
                  <p>As for the ſpoils which Paſſions commit without, and th' im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petuous motions wherewith they diſorder Society; if they overflow againſt particular men; and if they produce injuries and outrages, and the Revenge and Reparations which offended perſons take by their hands; greater and more dangerous Exceſſes ſucceed the firſt, The Preſervatives and Remedies againſt theſe evils, are found in the ſame Society wherein they are ſeen to bud and grow.</p>
                  <p>Wherefore there's no Government in the world, of what Spirit ſoever 'tis animated, and under what Form ſoever 'tis eſtabliſh'd, which hath not reſtrained from th' hands of particular perſons th' uſe of Vengeance, to tranſmit it to their Magiſtrates, as perſons diſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſſed; and for fear alſo, leſt Corruption ſhould penetrate even to the Functions of their Charges, and that the Juſtice they ought to di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtribute, ſhould be changed by ſome tincture of Paſſion which might inviſibly ſteal in, it hath been ordain'd, That the diſpenſation ſhould be made by the miniſtration of the Laws, that are incorruptible, and being incapable of Affection and Knowledge, are by conſequent in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>capable of Paſſions, and inacceſſible by Love and Hatred, by Favour and Riches: And that there may be no power in the State, but what ſhall bend under that of the Laws, nor ſo petty a perſon that ſhall not have Reaſon of the Greateſt that may offend him. The diſpoſition of publick Forces is committed to the Soveraign, wherewith he may reduce the moſt refractory and fierce Subject to th' obedience of com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon Right, and confine him within the bounds of Equity and Juſtice.</p>
                  <p>From hence it may appear, That th' uſe of Duels, whereby par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:33686:7"/>perſons endeavour to do themſelves Juſtice, and to draw Reaſon with their hands of th' injuries received from particular men; is a manifeſt violation of the Right of the People, and a particular Invaſion upon the Princes Right. And this Evil began by the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicious example of <hi>Francis</hi> the Firſt, and <hi>Charls</hi> the Fifth, and by the fatal accorded permiſſion of <hi>Henry</hi> the Second, encreaſed wonder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully in the time of our Civil Wars, and in that general depravati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of th' obedience and fidelity which Subjects owe to their Prince, and hath ſince riſen to its height, and is multipli'd infinitely by th' in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dulgency of <hi>Henry</hi> the Fourth, during the peace of his Reign. And as fruitful and fat grounds, if good Seeds are not caſt into them to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erciſe their fruitfulneſs, produce Thiſtles and Gorſt, and other hurt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful Weeds; it hath ſo happened to us, that men of courage wanting matter t' ingender lawful acts of valour, have given themſelves up to unlawful productions, and not being able to gain the Body, have purſu'd the Shadow, in theſe particular Combats, wherein <hi>France</hi> hath loſt more Noble Blood in a few years of Peace, than it had done in many years of War. But 'tis to no purpoſe to preach to our No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bility upon this Text, or to declaim againſt this Abuſe or exceſs of Courage, or to ſeek Remedies in Philoſophy or Religion againſt ſo Brutal a diſeaſe; or that the Blood which <hi>Henry</hi> the Second permitted to be poured out in the Combat of <hi>Jarnac</hi> and <hi>Chaſteneraye</hi> cried for vengeance to Heaven, and obtain'd it; or that the Prince, whoſe Qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity exempted him from th' hazard of Duels, loſt his life in a Sport which was the Repreſentation of it; that the moſt warlike Nations, except ours, of the world, have not admitted of that Baſtard-Va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lour, or at leaſt Naturalized it; That the <hi>Lacedemonians,</hi> who made a more expreſs profeſſion of true Valour than th' other <hi>Grecians,</hi> and whoſe Goverment ſeem'd t' have for Soul nothing but that Vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue, had no knowledge of Duels; That the <hi>Romans;</hi> who were the Conquerors of ſo many Nations and People, reſign'd it to their Vileſt kind of men, and to whom they had aſſigned Criminal lives onely for their objects; That the <hi>Spaniards,</hi> who have conceiv'd that great de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſign of th' Abſolute Monarchy, which hath agitated them above an Age, and for that purpoſe have declared and made War to ſo many other Nations, have by conſequence more need of Valour than any other Virtue, laugh at our modern folly; and if a ſleight imita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion corrupt them, or others of our Neighbours, 'tis but a ſpark that flies to them from the great fire which devours us; That 'tis an hor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rible injuſtice, that a perſon that hath ſweat in Arms, and been victorious in many Combats, Battels, and Sieges, ſhould be obliged to put his Reputation and Glory to Queſtion againſt a young Fool, who hath not ſeen any other Field of Battel than the Hall of a Fencing-Maſter, whoſe courage reſts upon th' agility of his body, and ſwiftneſs of his hands, and upon a long exerciſe of Aſſault and Defence: 'Tis to no purpoſe, I ſay, to repreſent all this to our Nobility, which can never be converted or healed, but by their own
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:33686:8"/>cure of this Folly, and by fixing their honour no longer in that falſe and furious Valour, and by beating down with its own hands th' ldol it hath erected for Adoration.</p>

                  <head type="sub">Why God hath left Princes the Right of doing themſelves Juſtice, when they are offended by other Princes; That Lawful War is in th' order of Virtues, and a Branch of Juſtice; Why 'tis called the Flayl of God's Anger.</head>
                  <p>WHAT hath been ſaid in the Precedent Diſcourſe, is one of the Motives which have obliged Particular perſons to make choice of Superiors, and t' impoſe on them the duty of diſtributing Juſtice; The price in part of the Liberty quitted for the love of their Superiors: But that would not ſerve for perfection of th' end pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed to themſelves in th' eſtabliſhing of them; And'tis not enough for the ſafety and proſperity of a Country, expoſed to the ſpoils of the Seas and Rivers, to raiſe Cauſeys againſt the overflowings of the Rivers, if Banks and Sluces are not provided againſt the Seas Inun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dations. The Invaſions made by Soveraigns upon th' Eſtates of other Soveraigns, and the Ruines they bring, when they enter with Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies, are evils of another weight and of another conſequence, than thoſe evils particular men ſuffer from other particular perſons; and other labours and effects are required to ſtop the cauſes of theſe pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick Springs of Deſolation, when they break out, than to ſuppreſs the ſmall diſorders, and appeaſe the petty troubles which ariſe betwixt private perſons.</p>
                  <p>'Tis viſible from hence, ſince Princes have no Superiors on Earth, to repair the wrongs ſuffer'd by other Princes, that they may do themſelves Reaſon; and that the Right of Nature, which permits to every man th' exerciſe of Revenge, when'tis juſt, is not ſuſpended, as to Princes, by the Right of the People, which takes it from particular perſons for the reaſons above mention'd. Whence it follows alſo, That God having taken away that Right, by reaſon of the Ignorance which doth uſually accompany them, or Paſſions that betray them, and walking in darkneſs, would grope to find the ways of Juſtice, or in weighing the worngs received, and ſatisfaction due, the perpetual motions of their lives might ſhake their hands, and hinder them to hold the Ballance ſtreight, This Right hath he given to Soveraigns, with this preciſe Obligation, That in their Underſtandings and Counſels, Reaſon ſhould preſide in all the purity of its light; that Paſſions ſhould have no admittance to their Cabinet Counſel, and that this holy place ought to be like th' higheſt Regions of th' Air, without emotion or trouble; That the miſchief is, that their Cabinet Counſel, inſtead of reſembling that high Region, is but too often
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:33686:8"/>the repreſentation of the Middle Region, and inſtead of calm and ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>renity, which ought to reign there, nothing is heard but the noiſe of Paſſions, and ſeen, but the fruits of Ambition and Avarice, and thoſe other great wandrings of mens underſtandings.</p>
                  <p>Though this be ſo, and that Evils are never ſmall, which grow from the diſorders of publick cauſes; 'tis nevertheleſs the gentleſt de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtiny, and moſt favourable entertainment, which the preſent condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of men can receive: Providence, after the loſs of Primitive Inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cency, and Original Juſtice, hath ſufficiently provided againſt this Inconvenience, and ſtrengthned Society againſt the deſigns of In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>juſtice and ſpoiles of Violence, by inſpiring men with Policy and Judgment to make choice of Soveraigns, that ſhould be obliged to defend them againſt the force of ſtrangers, and againſt th' unjuſt en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpriſes of their fellow-Citizens and Countrymen; and by impoſing upon them a ſtricter Obligation and ſeverer Laws to do their duty; becauſe the ſole faculty of doing Juſtice, and Inflicting of puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment is reſerved to them againſt ſuch as diſobey. To conclude, God hath not onely filled up the meaſures of good, which he did unto men, but hath alſo given them over-meaſure, in ſending the Law of Charity, and cauſing to deſcend from Heaven that holy fire, which dries up the very ſpring, and conſumes the very root of all ſharpneſs and violence, that may ariſe againſt ones Neighbour in the Souls of men. That if men fall ſo often ſick, and die in th' abundance of Good things, notwithſtanding the many Preſervatives and Remedies, and the large effuſion of graces and Relief, wherewith God hath ſupplyed them; If they are maſtered by Vices, and led in triumph by their Paſſions; if inſtead of Reaſon and Equity, Injuſtice and Force Reign and condemn th' Innocent with the Nocent; He hath permitted it, not to deprive men of th' uſe of that Liberty, which he had given in favour of them, nor to take from them the matter of Merit, by im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſing the Neceſſity of doing good; but that wicked perſons might puniſh one another, and honeſt men exerciſed by their contraries; and that all may learn, There's nothing more vile and more deſpica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble than life; That there's nothing but vanity and affliction of ſpirit in it; and that no true love is to be had for a Country, which for a few Flowers it bears, produceth many Briars and Thorns; and hav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing but a narrow path that leads to life, hath many ways, and large roads that lead to death, and end in precipices. This is to th' honor of Divine Providence. Let's return to our Subject.</p>
                  <p>'Tis eaſie to conclude from what hath been now ſaid, That as God is th' Author of the Juſtice, which Soveraigns diſtribute to their people, He is alſo th' Author of that Juſtice which Soveraigns exerciſe againſt other Soveraigns; that both of them have the Seal of his Approbation; and that th' uſe of Lawful Arms is no leſs a Virtue than th' uſe of Laws, when they are well diſpenſed. And this firſt kind of Juſtice, reſting upon the Baſis of its Nature, and not ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding the bounds of the Right of the People, is more noble and
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:33686:9"/>glorious than th' other; is a livelier Beam of the power, which God confers upon Princes, and a more illuſtrious evidence of th' honor they enjoy, to repreſent him on earth, as I have ſhewed in another place. 'Tis no wonder then if God, in th' Antient Law, commanded War to be made, and if he be there ſtyled, <hi>The God of Armies;</hi> 'tis of that Juſtice whereof we have lately ſpoken, and whereof we will draw the Platform and Habit the Figure in the ſubſequent Diſcourſes.</p>
                  <p>It may be demanded, whether the Doctrine which I have now de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>livered be true, and that War is a Branch and a Stream of Juſtice, and in th' Order and Claſſis of Virtues? As, whence it proceeds, That in the Bible, 'Tis called one of the Flayls of th' Anger of God? And wherefore in the New Law, God takes not the Title of, <hi>God of Armies,</hi> wherewith he ſeems t' adorn himſelf, and t' exalt his Majeſty in th' Old Law?</p>
                  <p>As to the firſt Difficulty, 'tis not uneaſie to reſolve, and many Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons may be brought to prove it: The Firſt, That the Juſtice Sove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raigns execute upon other Soveraign<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>, is called a Flayl, in compariſon of that juſtice they render to their Subjects; ſo that th' adminiſtration of this Juſtice being forbidden to particular perſons, and committed to a third kind of perſons, and of a diſintereſſed condition, is, by con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequence, leſs ſubject to Corruption than th' other ſort of Juſtice, where parties are Judges in their own cauſe, and where there's dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger, leſt ſelf-love entring the Counſels of War with Paſſions, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with it is uſually accompanied, occaſion a mixture of Injuſtice. The ſecond is, That although Right and Equity onely are propoſed in the project and birth of War, Accidents unſeen do many times happen in the ſequel and progreſs thereof, which change its nature, and degenerate it into a greedineſs of Vengeance, or into a ſole de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire of Ambition; and 'tis certain, that th' Appetite is provok'd by the facility of giving it content, and th' abundance of Meats makes it exceed the bounds of Temperance. The third Reaſon is, That the Juſtice which Soveraigns diſtribute to their Subjects, is rendred without Effuſion of blood, and without Violence, at leaſt in Civil affairs; the Juſtice they exerciſe againſt other Soveraigns is never guided but by Force and Arms, breathes nothing but death and murthers: And were the Queſtion onely for one inch of Earth, or a ſpoonful of Water, many Subjects muſt periſh on both ſides, for the juſt or unjuſt Quarrels of their Maſters; which ought not to be found ſtrange, ſince Soveraigns being th' Heads of the Body, whereof the Subjects are the Members, and as ſuch, being not able t' Act but in communion and conjunction with them; That they make an indiviſible communication in all things amongſt themſelves, and that th' Head being ſtruck, the Members muſt be offended; nor can th' Head defend it ſelf, without expoſing the Parts to blows, which make one Body with it.</p>
                  <p>So that the manner of Exerciſing this Juſtice, which is full of blood, deſolation, and ruine, may juſtly be called a Flayl; as Fire and
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:33686:9"/>Poyſon us'd in Medicines may be called by ſuch names, to diſtinguiſh them from th' other Ingredients made uſe of to heal ordinary Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eaſes: And it muſt not be denyed, but that the Juſtice rendred to particular perſons is ſubject, though not ſo often, nor ſo dange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rouſly, to the ſame Inconveniencies, and expoſed to th' Aſſaults and Ambuſhes of Vices, which are contrary to it; It muſt be confeſſed, That Reaſon and Equity do not always weigh down the Ballance; That there are bad Judges, as well as wicked Princes; And that in both Capacities, the Great oppreſs the Mean perſons, and the Poor are the Prey and the Sacrifices of the Rich: And ſince it is the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition and common Portion of Moral Vertues to Lodge betwixt two Extremes, and in the Confines of two oppoſed Vices, 'tis no wonder, if Man be troubled to contain himſelf in the midſt of theſe two Confines, without Entry into the Country of Vices, where he finds on all ſides the paſſages Eaſie, and where th' Errors and Inward Inclinations, th' Objects and outward Examples preſs him frequently to paſs.</p>
                  <p>The fourth reaſon it, That God hath ſometimes commanded a People to make War effectively upon another People, t' Exterminate them from the face of th' Earth, and to purge them with Sword and Fire, of the Crimes wherewith they had offended His Divinity, diſhonored Nature, and defac'd the Politique Body: Many Exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples there are of this Truth in th' Old Teſtament, and among the <hi>Jews,</hi> that beſides th' expreſs Commands God hath given to make War, He hath ſometimes raiſed and cauſed <hi>Soveraigns</hi> and their People to take Arms by occult and unknown Means, which are not here to be diſcuſſed, to chaſtiſe other People and other Soveraigns, that had offended Him: And this is proved in the Choice given to <hi>David</hi> by God, of the three Flayls of his Anger, the Plague, Famine, or War, t' expiate th' Exceſs of Pleaſure and Pride, conceiv'd at the ſight of the Numberleſs Number of the People, whereof he was the Maſter.</p>
                  <p>In the third place, That he cauſeth Accidents and Conjunctures, when he pleaſeth, which conſtrain Princes to make War that would continue in Peace, and to break the Chains of Concord that bind them, though they Act cordially to preſerve it, as I might prove by many Examples, If I had not fear to be tedious, and had not brought ſome Inſtances already in the Firſt Part of my Diſcourſe, That the Fire being kindled betwixt two Princes, tired with Labour in ſo painful, rugged, and dangerous a way, breathe nothing but Peace and Reſt; yet God hinders them to attain it by unexpected Acci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dents, which reſpectively beget one another: and when th' Haven is in hope to be gain'd, ſome contrary Wind is raiſed that forceth them to Sea again, and expoſeth them to new and more dangerous Storms.</p>
                  <p>Theſe Conſiderations, and many more whereof I am ignorant, are the Cauſe, That all War, how juſt ſoever, may be called a <hi>Flayl
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:33686:10"/>of God's Anger,</hi> and an Effect of his offended Providence; It may be demanded, ſince War may enter into the Claſſis of Virtues, and is of th' Apurtenances of Juſtice, how comes it to paſs, that God takes not, in the New Law, the glorious and fearful Title of, <hi>God of Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies,</hi> as he hath done in th' Old Law?</p>
                  <p>To this truly th' Anſwer is very eaſie, and who is it that knows not, if he have received any Tincture of Religion, and learned the firſt Elements of Chriſtianity, that the New Law is a Law of Peace and Love towards our Neighbour? That the Diſciples of <hi>Jeſus Christ</hi> are known by that Mark, and are diſtinguiſh'd from other Men by that Sacred Character; That the Father could not give a greater Evidence of his Love to men, than in giving his onely Son for their Redemption; That the Son gave the higheſt Proof of Charity in offering Himſelf Willingly, and Sacrifizing His Life Voluntarily for the Love of them; That th' holy Spirit was not ſeen but in the Form of a Dove, or in the Figure of fiery Tongues; And that the Church his Spouſe cauſed Oyl and Balſome to be put into th' uſe of the Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>craments, and other Holy Things, and no Violent Subſtances; which denotes, That the Spirit of the New Law is a Spirit of Sweetneſs, of Indulgency, and of Peace, and commands or adviſeth no other War, than what ought to be made to Paſſions and Vices; 'tis ſo far from allowing any Uſurpation, or Retention of other mens Goods, that it permits not men to Covet them; and ordains not onely, that Juſtice be done to our Neighbour, but adviſeth the ſupport rather of In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>juſtice and Injurie, than the Purſute of Reparations by Lawful Powers; nor to raviſh from Religion th' Evidences of that fair Maxim, which proceeds ſecurely from it, <hi>That Action is leſs Noble than Sufferance.</hi> If Juſtice then, which the New Law recommends ſo powerfully, and is the Vital Spirit and Natural Heat of the Civil Body, were impartially executed; and Charity that covers faults, which Juſtice would expoſe to light, and makes up the Breaches that Juſtice would leave open, were cheriſh'd by Chriſtians; ſuch men leaſt, would have need onely of the Conditions of Peace, and of the Counſels of Natural Equity amongſt themſelves, and there would be no occaſion for preſcribing to particular perſons the Forms of Plead<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings, or to Princes the Laws of making War; there would be no occaſions for Judges or Captains: All that are encloſed in the Womb of the Church would breathe nothing but gentle and peace<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able Air, the Revenge of Outrages would be taken in the Retribu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of good Deeds, and there would be no cauſe t' implore th' Arm of the <hi>God of Armies,</hi> of the <hi>Powerful and Terrible God,</hi> but only t' in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voke the Name of the God of Peace, and Father of Mercies.</p>
                  <p>But the Miſchief is, ſay the Poets, that Juſtice ſtaid not long amongſt men, and having carried the Ballance into Heaven, whither ſhe is re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tired, hath left onely the Sword on Earth, which Injuſtice and Vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence have laid hold on; That Charity, the Preſerver of Union, and the great Virtue of Chriſtianity, hath not reigned but amongſt
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:33686:10"/>the Faithful of the firſt Generation; That its Heat hath ever ſin<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">

                     </gap> diminiſhed; and 'tis viſible, that the preſent Chriſtians are more divided among themſelves than the <hi>Mahometans;</hi> and inſtead of acting againſt that Immortal and Implacable Enemy of their Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion, and publick Detainer of their Eſtates, have neither Under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding, nor Courage, nor Power, but to hurt and deſtroy them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves; Were Chriſtians entire, and their Forces united, it might coſt the <hi>Turk</hi> too dear to aſſault them; but by their Diſcords and diminution of Forces, they make the Victory eaſie for their Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies, the Blood which they pour out, and the Moneys they conſume, are th' Evidences of their Deſign, and a Proof, That if they have not Reſolution enough to fight the common Enemy, they have at leaſt Deſire enough to be taken. The Reader will excuſe this ſmall Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſſion, and this Complaint on the By, which the Zeal of Publick good hath forced from me.</p>

                  <head>Third Diſcourſe.</head>
                  <head type="sub">That Princes ought to Imitate God in th' Uſe of the Right he hath given them to do Juſtice themſelves; That 'tis very difficult even for Princes, who Love and Underſtand their Affairs, t' effect it; which is confirmed by two Examples, th' one of <hi>Henry</hi> the Second, th' other of <hi>Philip</hi> the Second.</head>
                  <p>IN the precedent Diſcourſe hath been ſhewed, That the Right God hath given to Princes of doing Juſtice themſelves, is the richeſt Effuſion he makes them of his Power, and the faireſt Beam he com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municates to them of his Light; whence we may conclude, To make this Repreſentation perfect, and that the Copy differ not much from th' Original, 'tis neceſſary, that they Imitate His Conduct, and March upon th' Impreſſions of his Providence, in th' uſe of that deſtroying Right, and in the diſpenſation of that bloody Juſtice. In the firſt place, As God never deſcends to this mournful Exerciſe, either pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſſeſs'd with Error, or troubled with Paſſion, Princes, if poſſible, ſhould do the ſame, they ought to ſee clearly into th' Action before they do Embark, and be well aſſured that they do nothing, but what is lawful for them to do; and to that end they ought to uſe the ut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt of their Power, that Reaſon onely have place in their Counſels, and that that great Tribunal, where ſuch important Reſolutions are taken, and the Sentences of Life and Death given, hold onely in that high Region of the Soul, where no ſmoak doth ariſe from the lower Region, as is above declared.</p>
                  <p>But as this is very eaſie to be ſaid, ſo'tis very hard to be put in practice; and 'tis as poſſible to reſiſt th' entry of the Sea, when the Winds drive it, as to ſhut the door of the Counſels of Princes upon their Paſſions, or upon the Paſſions of their Miniſters of State.

                     </gap>. All the world knows of the violent Schiſm which divided the Thoughts of the <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stable</hi> of <hi>Montmorancy,</hi> and of the <hi>Chancellor</hi> of th' <hi>Hoſpital,</hi> upon the Matter of the troubles, which vex'd the Minority of the Children of <hi>Henry</hi> the Second: And the famous Anſwer the <hi>Chancellor</hi> made to the <hi>Conſtable,</hi> who reproached him, That it belonged not to him, nor to them of his Profeſſion, to meddle with th' Affairs of Wars; <hi>That is belonged not to him nor to his Aſſociates to make War, But it belonged to him and to his Aſſociates to judge of the Time when it ought to be made.</hi> No perſon alſo is ignorant of th' obſtinate and invincible Averſion to Peace, which the <hi>Marſhal</hi> of <hi>Biron</hi> had, and what he ſaid one day to his ſon, who being not ſo great a Politician as the father, nor ſo foreſeeing of the Future, acted vigorouſly to put out and extinguiſh the fire of the War, which the father endeavoured to cheriſh and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flame; <hi>That if Peace was made, he reſolved to ſet Cabages at Biron, and to renounce the Court and Fortune.</hi> In this, truly there's nothing that is not very ordinary, and 'tis but too natural for every perſon to love his Profeſſion, and what contributes moſt to his Advancement and Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferment. But this is very ſtrange, that intelligent Princes do ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times abandont their Intereſts to wed other mens, and are indulgent to the Jealouſie or Ambition of their Miniſters of States, to the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>judice of their Affairs. Behold two memorable Examples, th' one drawn from our Hiſtory, th' other from the <hi>Spaniſh</hi> Hiſtory. <hi>Henry</hi> the Second was without doubt a Prince well inſtructed in th' Art of Reigning, and when he came to the Government of the State, very capable ot conduct it, his Prudence and Valour equally ſhined in the firſt years of his Reign, and his Fortune prevailed above <hi>Charls</hi> the Fifth's; and it may be ſaid, That th' Orient of his glory was the Couchant of th' others: After his Victories obtained in all places by his Arms, and Triumph in his Artifices, as we ſhall ſhew in another place, he ſaw the Courſe of a happy War ſuſpended by a Truce, which Crown'd the good Succeſs with great Profits, and an incre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dible Reputation. But the things of this world cannot ſtay long in the ſame condition, and that the favours of Fortune are not fixed; or that as men have accuſtomed to be weary of their proper felicity, and to love the change of good, it happen'd, that <hi>Henry</hi> did not ſtand firm in that poſture, which th' Heavens ſeemed t' have choſen to make him happy. After the promotion of <hi>Paul</hi> the Fourth to the Pon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tificate, th' Ambition of his Nephews heated immeaſurably th' ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tred he naturally bore to the <hi>Spaniards,</hi> and put it into his head t' en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavour
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:33686:11"/>a League with <hi>Henry,</hi> to drive the <hi>Spaniards</hi> from <hi>Naples,</hi> and to conferr it upon a Son of <hi>France,</hi> with very advantagious Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditions, as may be ſeen in th' Articles of that League: The thing was very difficult, and it was no ſmall affair to enage <hi>Henry</hi> in an Enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priſe which offended his Conſcience, in the manifeſt violation of pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick Faith, and was evidently hurtful to the State, in making it put forth of th' Haven, whither it was arrived with ſo much Honor and Profit, and t' expoſe it again to th' infidelity of the Sea, and to the dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger of Tempeſts. Moreover, <hi>Henry</hi> had ſo good a ſight, as to diſcover th' Apparances wherewith they endeavour'd to blind him, and had in his Council Perſons, that were proof to the Subtleties of th' <hi>Italian</hi> Wits, and to the Force of the Spirits of <hi>Lorrain.</hi> But the <hi>Caraffes</hi> and <hi>Sirs</hi> of <hi>Guiſe</hi> laid their Batteries to break the Truce, and the <hi>Queen</hi> was aſſaulted from all parts, and by all ſort of Engines, to perſwade the King to condeſcend. The Propoſition at firſt was ill received, for the Reaſons alleg'd; the <hi>Conſtable</hi> of <hi>Montmorancy,</hi> principal Miniſter of State, and principal Favourite, oppoſed it couragiouſly and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantly; the <hi>Marſhal</hi> of <hi>Briſſac,</hi> an able man in buſineſs, and a great Captain, preſented Remonſtrances from <hi>Piedmont,</hi> which were capa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to perſwade all that were capable to ſubmit to Reaſon, and give way to Truth; and there was no apparance, but that Reaſon and Truth ſhould prevail in th' Underſtanding of <hi>Henry,</hi> upon the Matter of their Contradictions.</p>
                  <p>But they did not prevail, and what one of the <hi>Caraffes,</hi> who was then at Court, could not obtain by th' Authority of the Pope his Uncle, wherewith he was armed; what th' Addreſs and Eloquence of the Cardinal of <hi>Lorrain;</hi> what the Credit and Reputation of the Duke of <hi>Guiſe,</hi> who was ſecond Favourite, and the Conſtables Rival, could not obtain, the Dutcheſs of <hi>Valentinois</hi> carried; and that Lady, whom the <hi>Sirs</hi> of <hi>Guiſe</hi> had gain'd into their Intereſt and Alliance, was the Devil that had taken abſolute and poſſeſſion of the King, and forced him to yield after a long defence, and to conſent to what ſhe would have done, or rather to what the <hi>Sirs</hi> of <hi>Guiſe,</hi> or the <hi>Caraffes</hi> did deſire, though it juſtled Honeſty, and was contrary to the Good of the State. Time made diſcovery of th' Imprudence of that Deſign, and broke the Charm which Reaſon could not defeat. Our enterprize upon the Kingdom of <hi>Naples</hi> failed, ſo ſoon as it was Embarqu'd, and we received Affronts inſtead of making of Conqueſts; <hi>France</hi> that was unfurniſhed of her faireſt and beſt Forces, and of the moſt of her Moneys, to give them to <hi>Sir</hi> of <hi>Guiſe,</hi> found it ſelf weak to reſiſt the Storm that came thundring upon <hi>Picardy</hi> by <hi>Flanders,</hi> and being not fore-ſeen, becauſe it was ſecretly raiſed, made the more dange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous Impreſſion in the Surpriſe. The <hi>Conſtable</hi> was overcome and taken priſoner before St. <hi>Quintins,</hi> and a little after the <hi>Marſhal</hi> of <hi>Furnes</hi> defeated near <hi>Graveline.</hi> Though <hi>France</hi> was aſtoniſhed at thoſe two great Blows, it was not beaten down, and thoſe interwoven ill Succeſſes, inſtead of choaking the Kings Virtue, raiſed it, and made
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:33686:12"/>him think of the Means of Return to his former Condition, and to withdraw with Honour from that ill poſture his Imprudence had caſt upon him; The King for that purpoſe recalls <hi>Sir</hi> of <hi>Guiſe</hi> from <hi>Italy,</hi> where he left none of his Reputat on, though he made no progreſs there, who was no ſooner arriv'd in <hi>France,</hi> but he took <hi>Calais</hi> from the <hi>Engliſh,</hi> and <hi>Thionville</hi> from the <hi>Flemings,</hi> who all obeyed one Maſter. Theſe great Beginnings were the preſages of a company of greater Succeſſes; and there was place for belief, that the conjunction of Duke <hi>John</hi> of <hi>Saxes</hi> Army to ours, which was very fair, would bring back to us the Victory, whereof our Enemies ſeemed to be in poſſeſſion, and would render us with intereſt our loſt glory, under a Chief ſo valiant and ſo wiſe as the Luke of <hi>Guiſe.</hi> But a Deſign, as imprudent, to make Peace, ceized on the King, as that which pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vailed with him to return to the War: And though according to all the Rules of Civil Prudence, and to all the Maxims of Reputation and Profit, he ſhould have continued the War, though it had been ill begun; it was ſtaid in the ſtrength of the proſperity that did accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany it, and Fortune was repelled that preſſed to be favourable unto us: He that expoſed ſo generouſly the Motion of an unjuſt War, was th' Author and Inſtrument of a pernicious Peace, and gave a preg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant Example of th' ordinary humor of the greateſt part of the moſt eminent Servants, to ſecond th' Intereſts of their Maſters when they concurr and agree with theirs, but quit them readily when they diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>agree; and when it cannot otherwiſe be done, ſecure their particular Intereſt to the Damage of the publick.</p>
                  <p>The Glory of the Duke of <hi>Guiſe</hi> hath long made the <hi>Conſtables</hi> heart to ake, and he perceived that the Dukes Genius had th' Aſcen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent of his, and that the Elevation of the Dutcheſs was his Deſcent and Decadency; The <hi>Conſtable</hi> by vertue of the Peace, how diſadvan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tagous ſoever to <hi>France,</hi> labour'd to withdraw from the Duke th' op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portunities the War had given him of Advancements, and of making further progreſs in th' Affections of the King, and in th' Eſteem of all <hi>France;</hi> He regained alſo by the ſame Means his Liberty, which enabled him to put a value upon himſelf without patience, which is a Virtue that is not of great merit, nor of great eminency in the Civil Life, and reſumed the Place which he held before in the Direction of Affairs: And ſo <hi>Henry,</hi> in being too compliant to th' covetouſneſs of a Miſtreſs, and to the jealouſie of a Favourite, made a Peace and a War unſeaſonably, and gave up to Love and Friendſhip th' Intereſts of Royalty, and the Duty of his Charge, which were incapable of Alienation. His Father underſtood it much better, and expreſſed a much ſtronger Paſſion for his Country, when preſt to receive his li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty upon exorbitant and ruinous conditions, he proteſted, <hi>That he had rather die in Priſon, that receive a Maimed Crown, and to leave his Succeſſors a Leſſer Kingdom then he had received from his Anceſtors.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The Second Example is of <hi>Philip</hi> the Second, whom all the world knew to be ſo deſperately taken with the love of Soveraignty, and
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:33686:12"/>with the Good of his Affairs, that he pardon'd not his own Blood, nor the Life of his onely Son, upon th' Advice was given him, that he ſtudied Miſchief, and was to paſs into <hi>Flanders,</hi> and there t' Eſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bliſh himſelf; Nevertheleſs this Prince, ſo Amorous of his Great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, and ſo Jealous of his Intereſts, hath declined ſometimes from that ſtrong Inclination, in favour of his Miniſters of State, and to indulge their paſſions to his prejudice; When the <hi>Flemings</hi> began to riſe againſt him, and t' open that famous Scene, where hath been ſpilt ſo much domeſtick and forein blood, <hi>Marguerita Princeſs of Parma</hi> their Governeſs reduced them, partly with Gentleneſs and Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dreſs, partly with Juſtice and Arms, to a reaſonable good Acqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſcence: But Tranquillity being not well ſetled, not all the Winds, which might trouble it, fully appeaſed; It was propoſed in the Council of <hi>Philip,</hi> what was fit to be done in that Exigency: The Council was equally divided, and as it were torn into two oppoſite Factions; the Chief of th' one of the Parties was <hi>Roderigo Gomez Prince of Eboly,</hi> who had for Followers the Duke of <hi>Feria,</hi> a good equal Inſtrument of Peace and War, and <hi>Antonio Perez,</hi> no leſs fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mous for the long and hot perſecution he ſuffered, as for the Charge of Firſt Secretary of <hi>Spain,</hi> which he had long exerciſed: <hi>Gomez</hi> was dextrous onely for the Cabinet, and ſuch Affairs were more in his Element, than the War; But his beſt Quality was, th' Inclination <hi>Philip</hi> had for him, and th' Art, whereby he adjuſted himſelf dex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trouſly to all th' Apprehenſions, and to all th' Humours of his Maſter.</p>
                  <p>The Chief of th' other Faction, was the Duke of <hi>Alva,</hi> whoſe Name carries in it ſelf Reputation and Luſtre enough, without giv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing it any other Addition to make him known; His Adherents were the Cardinal of <hi>Spinola,</hi> who formerly had ſo abſolutely governed <hi>Philip,</hi> that he was called the Monarch of <hi>Spain,</hi> and <hi>Granuelle</hi> Biſhop of <hi>Arras,</hi> who nouriſhed always Warlike thoughts under a Prelates Robe, and had a particular Revenge for them by whom he had been ill handled, and Renouncing his Adminiſtration, forced <hi>Philip</hi> to Recall him. The Duke of <hi>Alva</hi> was Improved in the Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>binet Counſels, and dextrous in th' Intricacies of them: But his prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipal Talent was the War, as the great Theatre of his Virtue; A Perſon, more conſiderable to his Maſter for the Services he had ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred, and might render to <hi>Spain,</hi> than Acceptable for the Conditi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of his Perſon, who being of a Proud and Severe Temper, was not beloved of them for whom he had done good.</p>
                  <p>Upon the Relation then, which was ſent by the Dutcheſs of <hi>Parma</hi> of the ſtate of th' Affairs of <hi>Flanders,</hi> the Chiefs gave their Advice ſingly, and Declare in ſhew and with Colourable Reaſons for the good of <hi>Philip;</hi> but in Effects, and bottom of their Intentions, Anſwerable to their Paſſions and particular Ends. The Prince of <hi>Eloby</hi> fearing, that if <hi>Philip</hi> went for the <hi>Low-Countries</hi> to compel by force the <hi>Flemings</hi> to their Duty, and to return them by Arms to
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:33686:13"/>the yoke they had caſt off, the Duke of <hi>Alva</hi> would be in great eſteem with the King, by reaſon of the Neceſſity of his Service, and draw the greateſt part of Gallant Perſons, and the beſt part of the Court, in Relation to his Charge and principal Command of th' Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my, rejected abſolutely the way of Arms, and Adviſeth that of Sweetneſs, and to permit the Little heat of Inquietude, which re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mained in the Rebels, to go out of it ſelf and without violence; But the Duke of <hi>Alva,</hi> who ſaw that the Peace had almoſt put him out of work, or left him on the Stairs, whilſt <hi>Gomez</hi> ſtaid at the Feaſt, maintained, that Nothing, but the Sword and the King's Preſence could Cure the Diſeaſe of the <hi>Flemings,</hi> and that the Power of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>belling was to be taken from the Rebels to ſecure from future Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bellions, And cut down the Tree at the root, to hinder the boughs from growing and putting forth.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Philip</hi> encloſed between theſe two Contrary Opinions, and ſeeing clearly though th' Intentions of thoſe two Counſellors, loving <hi>Gomez</hi> with Paſſion, and eſteeming <hi>Alva</hi> to his Merit, forgets his Maxims, and departs from his own Inclination, which was the Good of his Affairs, to content the Paſſion of them, by a Moderation that was fatal to him; He reſolved then for the ſatisfaction of <hi>Gomez</hi> to ſtay in <hi>Spain,</hi> under pretence that his Preſence was neceſſary to keep the <hi>Moors</hi> to their Duty, and hinder his Son <hi>Charls</hi> to diſturb in his Ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence; and to comply with th' Indocile and Imperious humour of the Duke of <hi>Alva,</hi> He conſtitutes him Governour of the <hi>Low-Countries,</hi> and gives him the Command of an Army capable to ſubdue them, in caſe of a general Revolt, and to force to ſubmiſſion all perſons that oppoſed him: <hi>Gomez</hi> found his Reckoning plentifully in being the chief of the two Patties, and remaining the moſt powerful of the Kings Council, was in ſome ſort ſuperior to the Duke of <hi>Alva,</hi> who ought to receive Orders from the Council, and as to the <hi>Duke</hi>'s Actions, could give what countenance he pleaſed to them, being not cleared before the King's eyes: The Duke of <hi>Alva</hi> alſo had cauſe to be ontent with the King's Deſign, to ſend him Commander of ſo powerful an Army, and t' exerciſe a great Charge in a Country, where no perſon was above him, and where he ſhould be Arbiter of the deſtiny of a great number of people, and of ſeventeen fair Provinces.</p>
                  <p>But th' Intereſt of <hi>Philip,</hi> and the Laws of good Policy, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired, that no Regard was to be had to th' Inclination of <hi>Gomez,</hi> nor to that of the Duke of <hi>Alva,</hi> and that he ſhould have gone in Perſon, and with a good Army into the <hi>Low-Countries,</hi> to confirm the Tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quillity, as yet unſetled, and to diſpenſe Rigour and Clemency ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the diſpoſition of Spirits, and exigency of Conjunctures; Or if it was not expedient for the King for important conſiderations to go from the <hi>Eſcurial,</hi> and to break the chains wich ty'd him to <hi>Spain;</hi> He ought not to have recall'd the Governeſs from <hi>Flanders,</hi> who might eaſily have finiſh'd what ſhe had happily begun, and had
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:33686:13"/>no need for that End but of a ſmall encreaſe of Forces to render her Adminiſtration a little more fearful than it was to the <hi>Flemings;</hi> who had in other Things Love and Reverence for her Perſon.</p>
                  <p>By theſe Example you may ſee, how hard it is for the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſellors of Princes t' enter their Counſels free from particular Paſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons; ſince th' ableſt Princes and moſt intereſſed, are ſometimes ſtruck with contagion, and ſpoil their Affairs by Compliance. It follows not, but that the perſons whereof we have now ſpoken were Great perſons, though ſometimes they committed faults, and that their Lives were excellent Looking-glaſſes for them that Govern, though the Glaſſes were not without ſpots; There are Illuſtrious Reigns, as Glorious Temples, and Magnificent Palaces; And though great effuſion of Riches have been made, and choice of the beſt Architects of the world to build them, ſome errors have been found in them. And the Things of Art have that in common with the Natural, not to be in all parts perfect. As in th' Oeconomy of the Manners of Men, Reaſon doth not always hold th' Aſcendent over the Paſſions, but that Paſſions ſometimes take it above Reaſon, and what is of the Dominion of th' Underſtanding, gives place to what is belonging to a Beaſt; So, though Princes oblige themſelves as ſtrongly as they can to repreſent the perſons of Princes, they cannot forbear many times to act the perſons of particular Men, and to cheriſh th' Incli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nations of Nature above the Duties of their Charge; Immutability from Good, is not of the Lot and portion of this miſerable Life; And Conſtancy unſhaken, but by ſome great change, is, in my ſenſe, one of the greateſt Wonders of the world; There is no Soul ſo mean, that is not capable of ſome fire, and of ſome ſtrein of Heroick Virtue; but there's none ſo Heroick, that can maintain without ſlacking the ſtrength of the flight, which it hath taken, and hold all things under it without ever coming under them: ſuch Souls as approach neareſt to this ſtate, and riſe and fall, whatſoever happens, leſs than other Souls, are certainly the Nobleſt and Faireſt of all Souls. And that Equality of Conduct, ſuch as may be gained in this Life, is more admirable and of greater price in it ſelf, th<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="3 letters">

                  <p>The ſecond Rule, which Princes ought t' obſerve in th' Uſe of this ſevere Juſtice, whereof we draw the Picture, is, That as God doth not puniſh ſinners at th' Inſtant they have offended, nor permit his Thunder to break upon the firſt crimes of Men; Soveraigns alſo ought not to haſten t' extreme Remedies, and take Arms ſo ſoon as they have receiv'd an Injury; They ought to conſider, that of all Imployments and humane Enterpriſes, there's none, wherein Preci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pitation is ſo dangerous as in beginning a War, nor wherein more paſſages are to be ſounded, or more ways know before the War be undertaken. They ought to remember, that beſides the ſad Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſity, which is inſeparable from the moſt Innocent War in the
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:33686:14"/>world, to devour a great number of Goods and Livers; There's none, wherein the Revolutions are ſo ſuddain, and the Concluſions ſo uncertain; A Wheel moved with violence turns not down with more ſwiftneſs, what was above; The Sea is not more unfaithful, nor changeth her calm with more promptitude; And th' hope of Labou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rers is not ſo often deceived by the ſterility of Harveſts; That the proſperities of Arms are ſubject to change, and th' Entries of War are belyed by th' Iſſues; That after many Fires kindled, and Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peſts raiſed; After a great quantity of ſpilt blood, and wealth de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voured; After a long Circumvallation, the High way to deſolation and ruine; 'Tis of Neceſſity, that the Liſts are to be re-entred, or a Retorn made to the firit poſture of Peace.</p>

                  <p>TO Avoid ſo dangerous a Precipitation, and not t' Engage herein t' ill purpoſe, and hoiſe ſail to the Wind out of ſeaſon, 'Tis not ſufficient to know that the War is Juſt, which is to b' undertaken, but that 'tis Neceſſary to b' undertaken; And 'tis the good of the State, which a Prince undertakes is this occaſion, more than any other Intereſt; 'Tis of Importance, that what is ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſt and profitable march together; and that the whole Motion of the War ought to turn upon thoſe two Poles.

                     </gap> what concerns it? In the firſt place, I ſay, that 'tis neceſſary it Reigns, if it may be over the whole Extent of the War, and expatiate it ſelf over the Accidents, as Matter of the War, and over the Form, as the Manner and Form, wherewith they ought to be conducted; For there are Matters, whereof I will treat to the bottom, and others which I will but lightly touch: For cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain, 'tis unworthy of a Man of courage to foul his hands in the cold blood of his enemies, and a moſt ſhameful thing for the feet to tread upon what the hands have beaten down, or to take away the life from him who demands it. Heat and Choler ought to be contained within the bounds of Victory, and ought not to be carried beyond it, unleſs of neceſſity to be done, which happens rarely, t' aſſure
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:33686:14"/>the Victory, or in Right of Revenge, to give no quatter to them, who Book would give no quarter; And permits that Plunderings be deſtroyed by Deſolations, and Fireings by Combuſtions. There are neverthe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs, ſome actions, wherein Revenge ought not to be taken, and 'tis unlaw full t' Imitate Robberies and Sacrileges, or to give th' Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies inhumane Deaths by their Example; there are Laws, which are called the Laws of good War, which the Marſhal of <hi>Briſac</hi> hath heretofore made ſo famous in <hi>Piedmont,</hi> that they ought to b' obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved, and made an Act of Juſtice, according to th' Intention of the God of Armies, and not a pure Violence and a manifeſt Breach of the Right of Nations, following the ſuggeſtions of the God of this World and of the Prince of Darkneſs, T' uſe expreſſions of the Bible.</p>
                  <p>'Tis true then, That a Priuce ought not to Draw his ſword, but when Juſtice puts it into his hand, nor Handle it, but under ſome form of Honeſty and ſhew of Conveniency. 'Tis alſo true, that h' ought not to confound what is Honeſt and what is Profitable, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe they are not the ſame Things, nor blend two Diſtinct qualities, as ſome of th' Ancients and Moderns have Done. Th' occaſion of growing Greater, and the facility of Conquering, ought not to tempt a Prince, unleſs he may Inlarge with a Good conſcience and Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quer Lawfully. Such a Moderation will be eſteemed more Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ragious and Magnanimous than any Act of valour, and no Victo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry can be ſo Fair and of ſo High a price as that which is gained up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on himſelf.</p>
                  <p>But to depart from general Termes, which are too Wild and In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>definite, and to deſcend to particular Conſiderations, which are more inſtructive and preſſing than the general. In the ſecond place, I ſay, That care is to be taken not to judge of the juſtice or injuſtice of an enterprize by th' Event, or to call it Bad or Good as it ſhall poſper and have the Winds Propitous or Contrary. Let him Obſerve with Averſion th' Expreſſion of that ſottiſh <hi>paniard,</hi> who ſollowing the party of the Commons raiſed againſt <hi>Charls</hi> their King, writ to a friend of th' Adverſe party; That the gain or loſs of the Battel, to be fought the next day, would declare, who had the Right of his ſide, and that the Mark and Reward of the Juſtice of the good party would be the Victory. Let him abhorr th' Advice th' Admiral <hi>Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stillon</hi> gave to the Prince of <hi>Conde,</hi> To make no Difficulty of brea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king the Treaty, whereby he had obliged to go out of the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome.</p>
                  <p>If the <hi>Sirs of Guiſe</hi> Retired from Court of purpoſe to charge the Kings Army, which they had laid aſleep, with th' hopes of Peace and Confidence in their promiſes, would the Victory make his Cauſe honeſt and his Armies juſt? and all other Juſtice ridiculous if it fell to the King, and all other Reaſon vain? If that be true, as it may be true, and if <hi>Davila,</hi> who reports it be no tdeceived, It were rightly to underſtand <hi>Machiavelles</hi> Maxim, Not to be wicked at Halfes; And to know how to ſatiate Malice: It were ſome what more than to
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:33686:15"/>ſew the Foxes to the Lions skinn. It were not to make Warr in th' Ordinary Way, but with poyſoned Armes; 'Tis then a prefixed point and a Conſtant Maxim of the Moral and Politique, That as a true Meaſure cannot alwaies be taken of the Prudence of an Enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prize by the Good ſucceſs, ſo true Judgment can never be made of th' Honeſty of an Action by the Good ſucceſs, nor the Juſtice of a War by the Victory that may Crown it.</p>
                  <p>In the third place, I ſay, As there's no War of ſo ſtrong a Neceſſity, and that hath th' Outſide ſo ſpecious, as when Piety is joyned in it to Juſtice, and th' Altars Defended in maintaining our Intereſts; To Intereſs God in theſe Deſigns muſt be avoided, unleſs he be truly in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſſed; As to imitate <hi>Ferdinand</hi> of <hi>Caſtille,</hi> who did much Worſe than take Gods Name in vain, for He ever Employed it to give Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lour to th' Evil which was beneficial to him; And his fears had been very much troubled to palliate their Ambition and Avarice, If there had been no Religion, Infidelity or Hereſie in the World: It ought not alſo to be believed, as ſome have perſwaded themſelves, or En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavoured to perſwade Princes, That the goodneſs of th' End, to the Glory of God, or the Salvation of Souls, can rectifie the Means, which are Ill in themſelves, or that the Venome or Malignity of a cauſe, is Corrected or tempered by th' Antidote of a Good and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fitable Effect, as ſhall be ſhewed hereafter.</p>
                  <p>In the fourth place I go on and ſay, That though a Hearty Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion is to be given to th' Authority of them, whom God hath pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced in th' Higheſt Adminiſtration of Religion, and in th' abſolute Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection of Conſciences; They muſt not, nevertheleſſe, b' obeyed in all things, as they do not pretend unto it; nor believe, that they can give Licenſe to do Ill, and diſingage us from th' Obligation of the firſt and ſecond Right of Nature. If <hi>Ladiſlaus</hi> King of <hi>Hungary</hi> had reſiſted the Legate who perſwaded him to break without Cauſe, or without other Cauſe than Conveniency, the Peace made with <hi>Amu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rat</hi> Emperor of the <hi>Turks,</hi> He had not permitted himſelf to b' a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buſed by that pretended Power, which the Legate aſſumed, t' untye the knot the Right of Nations had tyed; He had not loſt his life at <hi>Uarnes,</hi> with the loſs of the Battel; And <hi>Amurat</hi> had Reaſon, when in the midſt of the Fight and Heat of the Charge, the Victory ſeemed t' Incline of <hi>Ladiſlaus</hi> ſide, to call <hi>Jeſus Christ</hi> to the puniſhment of a Crime committed againſt him, and to chaſtiſe th' Infringer of a Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, wherein his Name was uſed to confirm it. If <hi>Henry</hi> the ſecond had followed th' Advice of the <hi>Constable</hi> of <hi>Mountmorancy</hi> and of the <hi>Marſhal</hi> of <hi>Briſac,</hi> who perſwaded him t' obſerve the Truce made with th' Emperor, which the ſuggeſtions of the <hi>Sirs of Guiſe</hi> and of the Dutcheſs of <hi>Valentinois</hi> diverted him from, under the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>text that the <hi>Pope</hi> had given him a Diſpenſation for it, He had not Expiated that Infraction by th' unhappy ſucceſs of his Armes within and without the Kingdome, and by that Long and Heavy chain of E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vils, wherewith <hi>France</hi> was after fettered.</p>
                  <pb n="21" facs="tcp:33686:15"/>
                  <p> Religion is not deſcended from Heaven to deſtroy the Virtues ſhe finds on Earth, or to Demoliſh Society, the moſt admirable Work that Reaſon hath brought forth, in over-throwing Faith its firſt foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation and principal Baſis; That, if ſhe forbids Commerce ſometimes and Communication with Infidels and Heretiques, 'Tis when that Communication may be Contagious to th' Underſtanding, and Dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerous leſt th' Errors and Vices be tranſmitted and paſs Joyntly with the Things permitted. And this is not ſo much a new and po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſitive Right, which Religion hath Introduced, as that Ancient Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand of the Right of Nature, <hi>T' avoid th' occaſions of Evil,</hi> which ſhe renews; or rather, 'tis that vaſt and unlimited Command which ſhe gives and applies to a particular Uſe and to a certain Matter; But though the Generation of Men be ſine torn in pieces by beliefs and cuſtoms, yet General Law; are left unto them, and a common Right; and ſince Infidelity or Hereſie impede not Soveraigns from being Lawful Lords of their Eſtates, nor Particular Perſons to be pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prietaries of their Goods; and by conſequence, that th' uſe of Commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tative and Diſtributive Juſtice b' equally open, and the Commerce for Temporal things, whereof they have need amongſt themſelves, permitted to all Princes and to all People, <hi>To Chriſtians and to Infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dels, To Catholiques and Heretiques,</hi> The Catholiques, as making profeſſion of a more Heavenly Doctrine and of a more Innocent Life, are obliged t' obſerve more Inviolably the Laws, and to maintain more Religiouſly the Privileges of their Nation than any People; To give no example of Infidelity and Deceit, which the Wicked may rebound upon Religion, and to make that fair Evidence of the ſanctity of their Beleef, to ſhine alwayes in the ſincerity of their Acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons. Not to ſink too deep upon a Matter, which I handle fully in a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother place, I will content my ſelf in relation to what I have now ſaid, to place here this Argument; To declare the Neceſſity of Keep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing faith with Heretiques and Infidels; as that with all them, with whom treaty and commerce may be had with a good Conſcience, Men are bound in Conſcience to perform things promiſed, when the Treaty is made, without fraud and violence, and without Juſt fear, which falls into the Souls of Valiant Men, and leaves them but a Lame Liberty. This Concluſion ſtreams ſo naturally and neceſſarily from its Principles, that there's no Need of other proofs t' Eſtabliſh it, not of other Lights t' Evidence it.</p>
                  <p>And yet, as there's no day ſo Fair, that is not over-caſt with ſome Cloud; ſo this Truth ſo Cleer and ſo Comformable to Reaſon, hath been expoſed to th' Art of Sophiſters: But who knows not, that this Depravation of Judgment hath proceede from an hot and blind Zeal, which many times ceiſeth upon the greateſt Doctors? or from a baſe and proſtiture Compliance to the wills of Princes, who would not ſtick at Perjury, If it might ſerve their turn, but would not publickly appear in it, leſt it ſhould Diſgrace them; ſo, this Doctrine truly, which came into the World but by Chance, hath not appeared
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:33686:16"/>by day, but by the violence of ſome cauſes, which have thruſt it on, and hath ever diſappeared with the cauſes that produced it. And St. <hi>Lewis,</hi> whoſe Piety cannot be queſtioned, but by impious perſons, was not ſtrucken with remorſe, when he had treated with the <hi>Sara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zens;</hi> And they that make uſe of ſuch means, would be very ſorry the like were offered them: As they who have conceived, though falſly, no better thoughts of the Truth of the Religion they profeſs, and believ'd it was permitted them to do the like in their time under the ſame pretext; The force and weight of this conſequence ſhall be ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amined at large in another place. If to this truth it be objected, That what is promiſed to Men, obligeth not more ſtrictly, nor ties a more indiſſoluble knot, than what is promiſed to God, wherein, 'tis certain, the <hi>Pope</hi> may diſpenſe ſome occaſions for important cauſes: it may be anſwered, That the Pope may do it, and may diſcharge th' obſervation of the Vow of a good thing for another of a better condition or equally good; But in this He doth but diſcharge his Charge from God, by virtue of his General and Particular Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion, to ſeek always what is moſt for his glory, and for the great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt good of Souls; he doth but manage God's Intereſts; but and in ſetting a value upon the Talent of the Faithful, and to be the good Husband and prudent Diſpenſator of the Benefits and Graces of his Maſter, whereof the Bible ſpeaks.</p>
                  <p>That to change a thing of ſmall, for a thing of greater price; 'tis to gain always by the Exchange, and to receive what is ſuperiour in value and goodneſs to what was quitted; 'tis to be a good Steward for God, t' Accommodate himſelf to the Neceſſities of Souls, and t' exerciſe a reaſonable Indulgency; 'tis t' obſerve th' Intentions of his Maſter, and the ſweetneſs of his conduct; 'tis to act the diſpoſition of that generous Creditor, wh' exacts not in rigour of his creatures what they owe him, but grants them always the compſition they deſire of him, and demands no more of them than what they can pay him conveniently, and without violence. But as to the Rights and Intereſts of Heretiques and Infidels, they have not, as the World knows, conſtituted the <hi>Pope Maſter</hi> or <hi>Arbitrer</hi> of their con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cernments; wherefore he cannot ordain or diſpenſe any thing to their prejudice in matters of Treaty, confirmed by mutual Oathes, and of common Right in th' affairs of Civil Commerce and Temporal Policy.</p>
                  <p>I paſs from this Matter t' another, wherewith 'tis naturally en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chained, and ſay in the fifth place, That Religion alone, whether it be for the planting of it in places where 'tis not known, or for the defence of it in States where 'tis perſecuted, cannot be the founda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of a Juſt War. That if the Writing of ſome holy perſons are fill'd with Exhortations to Chriſtians to take Arms againſt the <hi>Turk,</hi> and if the Predicants endeavour every day t' enflame them with that holy zeal; If <hi>Popes</hi> have heretofore publiſhed <hi>Croiſades</hi> for that ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject; And if the greateſt Princes of <hi>Chriſtendome</hi> did Enroll them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves,
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:33686:16"/>and have raiſed for that purpoſe great Armies; It muſt not be believed, it was done directly t' Exterminate the Sect of <hi>Mahomet,</hi> and t' aboliſh th' <hi>Alcoran,</hi> that Arms were taken up; or that it was to conſtrain the wicked perſons to change their Religion, or to force Chriſtianity into their ſpirits by the ſword: That is much eſtranged from the condition of our Religon, and very contrary to th' exerciſe of the Primitive Church, which oppoſed patience onely to force, and permitted no other blood, but the blood of her Children to be ſpilt, when it was oppreſſed, as ſhall be declared in another place, where the proofs of the ſecond branch of the Propoſition propoſed ſhall be produced. 'Tis then to the Limits of the Temporal Intereſts, that the War againſt the <hi>Turk</hi> is chiefly reſtrained; 'Tis directly againſt the Power of th' <hi>Ottomans,</hi> and no againſt th' Errors of <hi>Mahomet,</hi> that <hi>Chriſtians</hi> draw their Swords, and for their Commiſſion they have Right Valuable Titles; Th' Uſurpations made of the faireſt Members of their Empire, and the ſpoiles of ſo many Eſtates, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with the Tyrant adorns himſelf, are ſubjects which put it out of queſtion, that they may Lawfully Arm to Recover their Loſſes, and to Recollect the Pieces, which are taken from their Intereſts: And 'tis his conſtant deſign, and his Religion by a perpetual Vow binds him to labour the Deſtruction of Chriſtianity; and the ſpirit of that barbarous Religion, adorned onely with Rapines and Murders; with the Proſcription and Confiſcation of the Lives and Eſtates of all them, who are not of their Judgment, do give a juſt power to <hi>Chriſtians</hi> not onely to defend themſelves, when they are aſſaulted, and to reſiſt the ſtorm when it Beats on that ſide, but alſo t' aſſault, and to prevent, if ſome other Conſideration do not oppoſe it. That if the Courſe of the War and the Lot of Arms make it ſometimes neceſſary for a Chriſtian Prince to conclude a Peace or Truce with the <hi>Turk;</hi> He ought Legally t'obſerve Conditions, ſo long as the <hi>Turk</hi> obſerves them on his part, and to make no breach, if th' other do not begin or prepare to break. But if the <hi>Turk,</hi> who keeps his Soldiers in Exerciſe, and his Men of War in Action, and coaſts the Countries of his Neighbours to gain ſome prey, doth ruſh upon the State of a Chriſtian Prince in Confederacy with the <hi>Turk,</hi> any Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian Prince may relieve him with a good Conſcience, and Act Law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully againſt the <hi>Turk,</hi> without being a Violator of his Faith, or De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſertor of his World; For, beſides the Duty of Charity, and that ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral Obligation, which the Right of Nations Impoſeth to protect the Weak againſt the Strong; 'Tis Matter then onely of Defence, which is ever permitted, though it be Indirect, and ceaſeth not to be Juſt, though it be Anticipated. And to ſpeak the truth, what elſe doth a Chriſtian Prince, in repelling the Violence made t' another Prince, than prevent what is prepared againſt himſelf? Than make haſte to Quench the Fire which burns his Neighbours Houſe, before it lays hold on his, and aſſiſts to make Rampars and Barricadoes againſt the Sea, which might over-flow his, after it had drowned the
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:33686:17"/>Country of his Allies? But whilſt the Deſign of Ruine repoſeth in the <hi>Turks</hi> breaſt, and that th' Execution of the Vow is ſuſpended, the Conditions of the Treaty made with him ought inviolably to b' obſerved, without the leaſt infringement of the Zeal of publick Commerce, and of Faith, the principal Bond of the Civil life.</p>
                  <p>'Tis eaſie t' infer from what hath been ſaid; That Chriſtians in general have but too many formed Subjects, and too many prepared ways t' Enter, when they pleaſe, upon a juſt War againſt the <hi>Turk;</hi> and there's great cauſe of Aſtoniſhment, as I have obſerved in the firſt Diſcourſe, That inſtead of turning their Arms againſt an Enemy that is not leſs Powerful than Irreconcilable, they convert them againſt themſelves; they thruſt them into their own bowels, and make themſelves drunk, if it may be permitted t' uſe that Poetique bold<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, in the blood of their Brothers.</p>

                  <head type="sub">That the Defence of Injured Reputation is the ſubject of a juſt War; Wherein that Reputation conſiſts; That the King could not with honour avoid breaking with the <hi>Spaniards,</hi> who had cauſed the Town and th' Elector of <hi>Treves</hi> to be ſurpriſed, being under his Majeſtie's Protection.</head>
                  <p>'TIs not to the conceived that the defence of a Country, whether Direct or Indirect, in the Manner as it hath been circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribed, ſhould be the ſole Title of making juſt the Arms of a Prince; There are alſo other Titles and other Conſiderations which put Arms Lawfully int' his hand; There are other wounds t' heal, and other breaches to make up, than the Ruine of his Subjects; th' outrages acted againſt his Honour are to be revenged, and the ſpots wiped off which are imprinted upon the Reputation of his Crown, as one of the Pillars which bear up his Greatneſs, and therefore to be carefully preſerved from Blows, that it fall not in contempt. But in regard ſome may equivocate upon this word Reputation, and take upon that occaſion a ſubject of dangerous conſequence; it may not b'unneceſſary to clear and diſtinguiſh it, which may be done by a very eaſie diſtinction, and in a manner is already declared.</p>
                  <p>'Tis certain then, that there are two ſorts of Reputation peculiar to States, and which may be ranked in the number of Goods that be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>long to them; th' one conſiſts in th' Eſteem which the ſtrength of a Country hath gained from abroad, and in the glory of it; this is formed of the Merit and good fortune of the Prince; of the Num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber and Virtue of his Subjects; of the Duties of Subjection, and of the Rights of Soveraignty; in th' Extent and Situation of the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try; in the Fecundity of Mines; in Fortreſſes, and Arms, and Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munitions
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:33686:17"/>of War. Th' opinion then which ſtreams and flows from theſe things and other the like in the ſpirits of Men, Is the Reputa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion I ſpeak of, and where of no queſtion is to be made, but that the Prince ought to be very Jealous of it, as of a thing which ſometimes is of great Conſequence, when his forces are weak, and which ſome have compared very aptly to the credit of Merchants, which main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains them in honour and luſtre, though they b' effectively poore, and gives them often Means to fill up the Concealed emptineſs of their affairs, and to repair the weak Inviſible condition of their fortune; But when a Prince is wounded in this kind of Reputation, and his Forces are cryed down; when His proſperities are leſſened, and diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>graces Encreaſed; when Endeavours are uſed t' obſcure this Lu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtre of greatneſs and force, wherewith th' Eyes of Strangers ought to be dazled, and to draw a Curtain before th' Exteriour face of his Affairs; 'Tis not the ſubject of a juſt war; The reaſon of it is, that Strong Remedies are never to be uſed but againſt Extreme Evils, nor Violence acted againſt accidents that may be Over-come by Induſtry; There ought to be ſome proportion betwixt th' Arms of Reſiſtance and thoſe of Aſſault; When the combate is made by the forces of Wit, there's no Reaſon to bring the forces of our Body for defence; Falſe Reports are ſcattered abroad to our diſadvantage; Make the Truth ſhine in all places, which is contrary to them; Vigilancy and In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>genuity need not fear ſuch Artifices, and the deſigns of our Enemies will have a chance anſwerable to that of Mines, which do no hurt, if Vent be given them.</p>
                  <p>But there's another kind of Reputation and another ſort of Honour, wherein the Prince ought not to ſuffer the leaſt decay, but purſue a Reparation with Armes, if it may not otherwiſe be had, when offen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded. To ſpeak it in a Word, 'tis the Dignity of the Crown, and th' honour of Soveraignty: There are certain Privileges and Preroga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tives, which the Right of Nations have faſtned unto them, that ought not to be touch'd without Reſentment, or Violated or ſlighted with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out oppoſing it by force; Injury, for example, done to an Ambaſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dour, whoſe perſon is Holy and Conſecrated by common Right, and by conſent of all people, and of all Ages, is the ſubject of a Lawfull War; And <hi>Francis</hi> the firſt cannot be blamed for breaking with <hi>Charls</hi> th' Emperour by reaſon of th' Aſſaſinat of <hi>Rignon</hi> and of <hi>Fri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>goſe,</hi> his Ambaſſadors, whom the Marquis of <hi>Gaſt</hi> had cauſed to be Murdered, and could never have juſtice, in what poſture ſoever he put himſelf to Demand it; The Breach of a Treaty, which is the mark of Diſdain thrown at a Prince, or of the ſmall conſideration had of his Country, is another Title of juſt War; That if the Perſons of Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>baſſadours are Inviolable, and ought univerſally to be reſpected, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe they are the Living Bonds of Commerce, and th' Animated Inſtruments of the correſpondency of Princes; By the ſame Reaſons Treaties which are th' Inanimate Seals and dead Impreſſions of that Commerce and Correſpondency, ought to be holy; and the breakers
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:33686:18"/>thereof corrected with the puniſhment the Right of Nations permits to be inflicted; And as one of the Princes will take advantage of the violation of the Treaty th' other promiſes to perform, ſo by a neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary Conſquence th' other muſt receive Dammage, and that Right and faculty is obtained thereby to take reaſon of that Injury with the ſword in th' hand, if it be not given Civily and in a friendly Manner. It may be ſeen by this, That the War which the King made to Duke <hi>Charls,</hi> is no Unjuſt violence, nor the Conqueſt of <hi>Lorraine</hi> an unjuſt Invaſion ſince it hath been drawn on himſelf by the violation of ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny Treaties made with <hi>France,</hi> and who can take it ill, if he have not loſt all ſenſe of good, and the Taſte of all that's juſt, That what was left in pawn and for ſecurity of a thing promiſed, ſhould be forfeited, when the promiſe is not performed; and the depoſite Detained when the condition for reſtitution is broken? But I purpoſe to Treat fully of this Matter in the ſecond part, and t' undraw the Curtain which I d' here leave, at leaſt if the condition of the time permits it, and prudence adviſeth it.</p>
                  <p>Obſerve another Eſſential point wherein Reputation is offended, and for which Armes may lawfully be taken in hand, and War made. 'Tis to redeem a Prince from vexation for the hatred is born us, and becauſe his Intereſts have ſome Conjunction with ours. The King had juſt cauſe to defend the Duke of <hi>Mantoua</hi> by his Protection and Arms againſt the deſign of the <hi>Spaniards</hi> to ſtrip him, even for that Reaſon, that he was born the Kings Subject, and that they could not ſuffer a <hi>Frenchman</hi> to be a Soveraign Prince in <hi>Italy.</hi> How deeply the honour of <hi>France</hi> was Wounded with that ſtroak, and what ſhamefull Reflection was made by that Attempt upon the Dignity of the Crown, There's not a perſon but may judge of it without Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>planation. There's not a perſon if he be not altogether blind with paſſion for <hi>Spain,</hi> that can approve of their project t' eſtabliſh in all places their Dominion and t' extend their Monarchy; They ſhut the Door into <hi>Italy,</hi> and forbid Entrance to the <hi>French,</hi> what Juſtice ſoe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver opens it, and what Right ſoever calls them thither. And they who Take at all hands and Uſurp on all ſides, will not permit the true and Lawful Maſters t' Enjoy their Lands, or gather what belongs to them, if they are friends to <hi>France.</hi> The Reaſons the King had, are remitted to another place, and th' other Motives which excited him t' Eſpouſe the protection and undertake the defence of the Duke of <hi>Mantoua.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Honour obligeth alſo a Soveraign, beſides other duties which may invite him, to make the protection given to a weak Prince to be eſtee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med, and to cauſe the Sanctuary offered to an unfortunate Prince to be reſpected; I will explain this propoſition by an Example. After that the late King of <hi>Swede</hi> was Entred <hi>Germany</hi> with that Extraordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary ſucceſs which accompanied his Virtue, and that He had taught the Houſe of <hi>Austria</hi> to know that it was not Invincible, and had a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtoniſht it with the blows received from th' hands of a Conqueror; Its greateſt Care was t' avoid a Ruine, and as in a wrack to get ſome
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:33686:18"/>planks whereon to ſave what remained of goods and hopes. The King wh' alone could put a bridle upon th' Ambition of this brave Prince, and Reſiſt the Tempeſt which threatned the Catholique friends of that diſconſolate Family, offered them his Royal protection, and the ſhade of his Authority, without which there was no Safety nor Recovery for them.</p>
                  <p>Th' Elector of <hi>Treves</hi> beleeving He was not bound to periſh with them who probably could not ſave themſelves, nor hinder him from falling, but to fall onely for Company, accepted of his Majeſties pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tection. After that, who makes queſtion but the King in honour and Reputation was obliged to defend th' eſtates and the perſon of that Elector from all th' Enemies Excurſions, and to turn alſo his Armes upon the <hi>Swedes</hi> in caſe they did not conſider as they ought his pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tection, but ſhould violate his ſafeguard? And in truth the King was ſo Religious in this behalf, that He conſidered not what was Profita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble in compariſon of what was Honeſt, nor the good of his Affairs in compariſon of th' honour of his Word. That his Majeſty entred up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on ſome Coldneſs with the <hi>Swede,</hi> when he delayed the ſatisfaction was deſired, and to reſtore a place the King was obliged, after the <hi>Swedes</hi> had taken it, to cauſe to be rendred to th' Elector. That if the King had reaſon t' uſe ſuch a proceeding in favour of his Allyes, and t' hold forth to them ſome Little Rigour upon that occaſion; 'Tis viſible that he had cauſe upon Stronger terms of Juſtice and Duty to break with them who gave ſuch Advices, and Lent their Armes not only t' undertake upon th' Eſtates of th' Elector of <hi>Treves,</hi> but alſo t' attempt upon his Liberty, and to make a Prelate and a Soveraign Prince their Priſoner, with whom they had no cauſe of diſpute, not had offended them, and againſt whom they had not declared any War. What can they allege to ſweeten this Violence? and what play<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter can they find to diſguiſe and make plauſible ſo heinous a buſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs? If it were for the Love of us, and for the protection we did grant him, that they oppoſed an Innocent Perſon, It muſt be confeſſed that the hatred they boar us was not onely very Implacable but alſo very Unjuſt, ſince it labours to kindle a fire and exhale Venome even out of our good Actions which are not oppoſite to them; ſince it cannot permit us to Protect them whom they could not Relieve, and ſecure them as ſhelter againſt the ſtorm wherewith they were firſt beaten; ſince they deny us even the duties of Charity, which flow from the Right of Nature, and would take from us all ſorts of cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſpondence with other Princes, and even the power of doing good offices.</p>
                  <p>It being thus, I leave it to the Judgment of the free and unpaſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>onate Reader if they or we in this have begun the Quarrel, Who were the Breakers of the peace at <hi>Vervins</hi> and the firſt Authors of the War; Have they not done the ſame things, as if they had broken th' Expreſs clauſes of that Treaty, when they have violated that for which ther's never any Treaty, and which is ſufficiently underſtood
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:33686:19"/>without being put into a Treaty; that one Crown ought not t' at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt againſt th' other, nor offend it in the perſon of them it pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tects and ſhadows with its Authority and Arms; ſince they have not reſpected our Allies, and what the Peace of <hi>Vervins</hi> laid Quiet hath been Inviolable in relation to them; Can it be ſaid, that they have not been the beginners of this Quarrel? that they have not lighted the Torch of the Diſſention of the two Crowns, and begun the War by Surpriſes and Robberies which have been continued openly upon us, and after declaration of it? If they do remember the Moderation of our Conduct, and the Favour ſhewed, that was not leſs than of Life, to th' Imperial Troops which had ſurpriſed <hi>Heilderberge,</hi> they may ſee, that we have always avoided with great care to Break with them, who have no Love for us, and having no fear for the Forces of our Enemies, have always apprehended the Ruines of the War, and the Deluge of th' Evils that attend it; That if they will ſay, they have not immediately aſſaulted us, and did not directly undertake us, and that they looked onely upon th' Elector of <hi>Treves,</hi> whom they had right to chaſtiſe for departing from the protection he was bound to receive from th' Houſe of <hi>Luxumburge,</hi> whereof they are Heirs, and for repairing to a forein protection, which is a kind of Diſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bedience<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> That 'tis the Crime they have purſued, and their offended Honour they would repair at the Charges of him that was culpable; Obſerve truly the Foundation which bears and ſuſtains all the Juſtice of their ſpecious Cauſe; behold the Pretext where with they do pal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liate it; behold the fair Colour wherewith they do paint it: There's nothing nevertheleſs eaſier than to ruinate that foundation, than to deſtroy that pretext, than to rub out and deface that colour, for when it ſhall be true, as they ſay, as 'tis not, and that there were no Example, as we are aſſured there is contrary to what they pretend, that th' Elector of <hi>Treves</hi> is under the protection of the Houſe of <hi>Luxumburge,</hi> which they have annexed to theirs; dare they deny, when that protection is unable to defend it, and the Fort not ſo well guarded as to ſecure it, but that 'tis lawful to repair to a more Power<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful protection, and to ſeek a ſtronger Sanctuary? Doth a firſt pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tection exclude a ſecond? Is there but one Sanctuary open againſt perſecution? and may not Society be made, and an Intelligence formed betwixt two good things of the ſame Nature? The City of <hi>Geneva,</hi> hath it injur'd the Canton of <hi>Berne,</hi> and wounded the Dukes of <hi>Savoy,</hi> when it fought ours, and put Her ſelf into Harbour and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the protection of this Crown? Did the King proſecute and purſue to violence the Duke of <hi>Mantoua,</hi> for obtaining the protection of the <hi>Venetians,</hi> at the ſame time he did enjoy his Majeſties? And have the <hi>Venetians</hi> made War with him, or Incurſions into his Eſtates, or In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vaſions upon his perſon, for having ſo often implored the <hi>Pope</hi>'s pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tection? And there's nothing more compatible or more ſociable, than a permanent and ordinary protection with an extraordinary, which doth not continue, but paſſeth and ceaſeth with the danger
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:33686:19"/>that procured it; And a Prince is very Unhappy, or very Impuru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent, who is reduc'd to a ſingle Expedient of Conſervation, which may fail, and to get out of a croud and violence of affairs, knows but one Iſſue, which is not always Free, and hath but one Gate whereof he is not always the Maſter.</p>
                  <p>But ſince the Safety of the People is the Soveraign Law of Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernours, and that other Laws of States have neither ſpirit nor life, but what is derived to them from that Principal; who can imagine that a Prince had made a Treaty, by the which He had bound him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf to periſh, as often as another Prince had not the power to protect him, and ſhould embrace a Dependency, by which he renounced all the means of providing for the Conſervation of his Subjects, which ſhould oppoſe the pleaſure of th' other Prince? Such and the like Treaties ſhould be rather Prodigies and Monſters to be extermi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nated out of the Politique, than valuable and lawful Acts that had proceeded from the Authority of Princes, which is not inſtituted to destroy and to demoliſh States, but to divert the fall, and repair the ruines. I add to this, that the word of Protection ſufficiently de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clares, what th' operation and uſe thereof ought to be, and having the ſafety chiefly of Eſtates, and good of the perſons protected, for its Mark and End; It ceaſeth to be what it was, if it falls into Impu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iſſancy, and if it hath not force nor vertue to conſerve and to defend; It changeth its kind, and paſſeth into another Nature contrary to hers, if it become a principle of Ruine to them whom it ought to ſerve for relief againſt ill fortune, and if it degenerate into Poiſon in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tead of being a Preſervative.</p>
                  <p>Let's conclude, Since th' Houſe of <hi>Auſtria</hi> was not in a condition to warrant any perſon from th' ill weather wherewith it was beaten, and that even they who were Embarqued in the ſame Veſſel with her were in danger to be loſt, if they did not quit it, th' Elector of <hi>Treves</hi> did not offend th' Houſe of <hi>Auſtria</hi> in making Addreſſes to <hi>Franoe,</hi> that was his onely ſafe Haven to ſecure him from a ſtrong Wind and an angry Sea; I ſay further, That He did not onely an action of Duty towards his Subjects, in diverting by our mediation th' infallible deſolation which hung over their heads, or an act of Piety towards the Church, in ſecuring by our means th' Holy Places and Sacred Perſons; but hath not a little merited from th' Houſe of <hi>Auſtria,</hi> if it were capable of ſome ſenſe of Acknowledgment, and would be ſenſible of a good Turn, by hindring his great and formi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dable Adverſary by his fore-ſight and addreſs, from growing greater by the Conqueſts of thoſe Eſtates, and to make a dangerous con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>junction of the <hi>Rhyne</hi> with the <hi>Moſſelle,</hi> and at the ſame time t' extend his Arms into <hi>Flanders</hi> and <hi>Germany;</hi> And therefore let the World judge upon theſe true and pertinent Facts, if that Elector hath deſerved th' uſage he hath received for his love to us, or whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther the King could paſs by ſuch injuries without reſentment, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claring a War to them, who have ſo highly offended in the perſon
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:33686:20"/>of one of his Allies, and in the ſight and knowledge of all <hi>Europe.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>This Example, and many others which I ſhall ſpeak of in their place, will make it clearly appear, that the King did not engage in all the Wars, wherewith miſerable <hi>Chriſtendome</hi> hath been vexed for many years, but for the protection of the weak againſt the ſtronger; and that th' Houſe of <hi>Auſtria</hi> by its untameable Ambition, hath broken the Bands of publick Concord, and kindled the fires, whoſe deſtruction it may feel, as well as any other Houſe, before its burn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing be quench'd; God alone knows, what Event ſhall be of ſo many Armies raiſed, and where th' agitation of ſo many provoked Nations ſhall determine. But the King ought to have this ſatisfaction and reſt of conſcience, that he hath not been th' Author of theſe lamen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table troubles, but hath done his Endeavour to divert them, ſpared nothing to ſtop them; and having laboured much, and taken much pains t' eſtabliſh and ſettle the tranquillity of his Kingdom, Had not a livelier and hotter paſſion than to procure th' entire felicity of his people, and to ſee that peace flouriſh he vvould have given them, by th' abundance vvherevvith he had crovvned it, had he been Maſter of the Hearts of Strangers, and Arbiter of the Deſtiny of Things.</p>

                  <head type="sub">That a War ought not onely to be a Just, but alſo Profitable for him who undertakes it; Some Rules, which Princes ſhould obſerve when they relieve their Allies.</head>
                  <p>AFter Diſcourſe of the Cauſes, that make a War Juſt, and handling of that Thorny Matter, that hath, yet, ſome need of culture, which may be given it in its proper place; The Profit of a War muſt be handled, which is th' other Condition that ought t' accompany a War, and without which a Prince ought not t' en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gage, though it ſhould be, not onely full, but filled up with Juſtice.</p>
                  <p>If follows not, nevertheleſs, that this Profit ought to be preſent and ſenſible; nor is it in th' order of things to Reap in Sowing, nor that the firſt Preſcriptions heal a ſick perſon, or that a Picture be finiſh'd at the firſt Draught: God alone, in giving the firſt ſtroak, can give the laſt hand to his Works, and finiſh in beginning; yet, he hath not always done it, and he made uſe of ſix days to create the World, and to produce and publiſh the pieces of that Marvellous Frame.</p>
                  <p>As for the Works of Men, Time and Patience are neceſſary be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore th' End can be obtain'd; there are many degrees to clime before they can get to the Feaſt, and ordinarily 'tis with them as with thoſe of Nature, where the Generation of the moſt Excellent things, is but the ſequel of a precedent Corruption; It ſufficeth then, that it be a
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:33686:20"/>future Utility, to th' end it oblige t' act, and that it be known for ſuch: not with Infallibility and Certitude, which appertains onely to God; But ſo far as one may judge of it by the diſpoſition of Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond cauſes, and by the Rules of Civil prudence, which is all that can be required from the conduct of Men, and from the chance of this Life. Th' Advantages which ought to return from the War made in favour of Friends and Allies, and from the Relief is afforded them, ſhall be here treated of; as for others, either there's no dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficulty in them, or what ſhall be ſaid of this may clear the Trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles that be in it.</p>
                  <p>I will give thee ſome Rules then, which will diſcover to Princes the ways they ought to take, and the Rocks they ought t' avoid, when they engage in ſuch Aids; The firſt Rule is this, That th' Uti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity they ought to purſue and propoſe to themſelves before they take up Arms in favour of their friends, ought not to be Mercenary; not of the nature of what Merchants ſeek for their Traffick; th' ulti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mate End of their Ambition, and the principal Object that ſtirs up their Induſtry, is the Encreaſe of their Riches; they hazard Little to gain Much; they do like the Husbandmen, who ſow not onely to recover their ſeed, but to multiply it; and 'tis not, to ſhut the door of their houſe upon Poverty, that they labour, but t' introduce Abundance; The Reputation alſo of able and intelligent Perſons in their profeſſion concerns them not, or very little, they think onely of being Rich, and Profit makes up all the Glory of their Exerciſe, and all the Price of their Induſtry. There have been Princes in all times, who have acted in that Manner, and have been poſſeſt with that baſe paſſion; that the greatneſs of th' Object and Enormity of th' Evil, have cauſed to be called, Illuſtrious; but they that are enflamed with the Love of true Wiſdom, and with the Deſire of a fair Reputation, ought to ſail with another Wind, and take a very different way.</p>
                  <p>Let this then be a conſtant and indubitable Principle, That a Prince ought not to be perſwaded to take Arms in favour of another Prince by the ſpirit of Avarice, and by a greedineſs to grow Greater at his charges, t' enrich himſelf by his Spoils, and to keep the Securi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, which th' other Prince hath put into his hands for aſſurance of his faith, or to ſerve him for retreat; If that were modeable, no perſon would be found, that had not rather try th' Hazard of Arms, and runne of the Fortune of Wars, whoſe Events are doubtful and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>certain, than expoſe himſelf to th' infallible Loſs of all his Eſtates, or of a great part of them. That as there's no queſtion but the Wounds received in the heat of the War, and from an Enemy to whom one doth the worſt he can, are leſs offenſive and grievous, than thoſe that are received in Cold blood and from a Friend; ſo the Loſſes re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived from them, who ought to ſecure us, are of worſe taſte and of harder diſgeſtion, than thoſe occaſioned by ſuch perſons, as have de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clared the War againſt us, and have undertaken to ruine us. And the late King had reaſon, after th' <hi>Arch-Duke</hi> had beſieged <hi>Calais,</hi>
                     <pb n="32" facs="tcp:33686:21"/>and the Queen of <hi>England</hi> had ſent to offer him her Sea-Army up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on exorbitant conditions; to refuſe that relief, and to command it to be told her, <hi>That he had rather his Enemies ſhould ſtrip him than his Friends.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>By this Artifice, the <hi>Romans</hi> have partly marched to the Conqueſt of the World, and from People that made War againſt one ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, they poſſeſſed the Country of him who call'd them to their aid, and ſubdued th' others Country; 'tis by that means, the miſera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble <hi>Grecians</hi> finiſhed their deſtruction, and that their diviſions and diſorders delivered them up to the ambition of that People, who found no better Expedient to determine their differences, and t' ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinguiſh their partialities, than to take from them the power of Quarrelling, and to deprive them of their Eſtates, which were the ſubject of all their hatreds. 'Tis with this pernicious Artifice, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceitful Charity, that th' Houſe of th' <hi>Ottomans</hi> hath ſeized upon ſome Members of th' Empire of Chriſtians, and caught into their Nets the faireſt part of <hi>Hongary.</hi> The paſſage of Protection t' Uſurpation, is ſo pleaſant for the Conquerors, and their Limits ſo near, that the moſt Religious ſtick not at leaping over them, and to confound the two Actions, in diſtinguiſhing of them onely by Name, and giving the ſhadow of difference for what in effect is but the ſame thing-In Chriſtendom a Family is to be ſeen ſtruck with the ſame diſeaſe, the deſign of Monarchy, as th' antient <hi>Romans</hi> were, and th' <hi>Ottomans</hi> are of this time, that hath marched, to th' uttermoſt of their ſtrength, upon their ſteps, and plaid, among Chriſtians, the like game; Their cuſtome hat been to take part in all affairs, and to run to the leaſt noiſe of diſcord they hear amongſt men, and to the leaſt flame of diverſion that appears to them; they never obſerved a Neutrality whilſt War was amongſt their Neighbours, and conſidered not ſo much the Juſtice of the Party they made choice of, as the Means to gain by it, and thereby to get ſome Pawn to keep, or make a Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queſt; their protections have been the impoſitions of many Yoaks; and where it hath not impoſed a Subjection, it eſtabliſhed a Depen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dency, not much lighter, and though leſs grievous, yet aſſured them who depended upon their power, and held them by as ſtrong and indiſſoluble Bands.</p>
                  <p>There's no need of going out of <hi>Europe,</hi> or this preſent Age, to confirm this Truth, by antient and forein Examples; <hi>Germany</hi> and <hi>Italy</hi> have been the Theatres, wherein it hath evidently appeared in our time, and entred in pomp and glory. In two the moſt remarka<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble actions which have been there repreſented, a more illuſtrious example of this nature can hardly be ſeen, for the novelty of th' In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cidents, and for the rarity of the Circumſtances, which are there en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>countred, than that whcih hapned in the Succeſſion of the Duke of <hi>Cleves,</hi> claimed by the Duke of <hi>Newbourge,</hi> who was protected by the <hi>Spaniards,</hi> and by the Marquis of <hi>Brandebourge,</hi> whom the <hi>Hollan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders</hi> aſſiſted. But in regard I have an exact and ample Treaty of
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:33686:21"/>this Affair in the third part, I ſend the Reader thither, to ſpeak of a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother Example which <hi>Italy</hi> hath furniſht; after that the ſucceſſion of <hi>Mantoua</hi> and <hi>Mo<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">

                        </gap>ferrat</hi> fell to the Duke of <hi>Nevers,</hi> againſt which the <hi>Spaniards</hi> planted their Batteryes, and did their uttermoſt t' ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude him; T' attain then their End and t' hit their mark, They made uſe of a double Artifice, and planted both pieces in Battery; The firſt, in ſtirring up the Prince fo <hi>Guaſtalde</hi> t' intermeddle with that ſucceſſion, and t' oppoſe an Apocryfal and Imaginary pretenſion to the Cleer and indubitable Right of the Duke of <hi>Nevers,</hi> They En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavoured, if what was publiſhed then in <hi>Italy</hi> be true, to raiſe even a Baſtard of the Precedent Dukes, named <hi>Yacinthe,</hi> to make him En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gage in the Quarrel, in purging him from the Viciouſneſs of his birth, under pretences that had ſome Colour, but which Juſtled directly a Conſtitution of the Council of <hi>Trent</hi> received in <hi>Italy.</hi> But Lets leave the buſineſs of <hi>Yacinthe,</hi> t' hold us to that of <hi>Guaſtalde,</hi> which admits of no queſtion, as publiſht to th' Eyes of all <hi>Europe,</hi> and raiſed a ſcandal, as far as <hi>Conſtantinople.</hi> The ſecond Artifice is, That they abuſed the Name and Authority of th' Emperor to Compel the Duke of <hi>Mantoua</hi> to put his Forts in Depoſite into th' hands of a Commiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſioner, who was their ſubject, till th' Emperor had declared his Judgement upon that difference, and done Right to th' intereſſed Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties; That's to ſay, to give time to the <hi>Spaniards</hi> to form a Multi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude of Incidents and of Tricks to ſtretch and perpetuate the Matter in Conteſt; That the Length of the purſute, and deſpair of the ſucceſs in a Court where the Parties were Judges, might force the Duke of <hi>Mantoua</hi> to Conſent to their Will, and to yield a viſible Title of Juſtice to a pure Oppreſſion and an effective Violence.</p>
                  <p>The deſign then of th' Ayd they offered to <hi>Guaſtalde,</hi> or that he, if you will have it ſo, had implored from the, did not extend to the raiſing him to the Soveraignty of <hi>Mantoua</hi> and <hi>Montferrat;</hi> But to make themſelves Maſters of <hi>Caſal,</hi> and to deliver themſelves of the Jealouſie that Fort gives them; and from th' Apprehenſions it gives to the ſtate of <hi>Milan,</hi> for which they have ſo much Love and Ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derneſs; And that their Injuſtice might reign in all parts, and be dila<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted as the ſoul, in all the body of that affair; And that there might not be Principal or Acceſſary, but ſhould taſte of its venome and of ſome Tincture of violence; 'Tis to be Conſidered, that before <hi>Guaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>talde</hi> had attempted this Action and formed his Complaints at th' Imperial Court; whilſt the Prince of <hi>Mantoua</hi> paid there his ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary Duties on his Fathers behalf, and made his requiſite ſubmiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion; Whilſt they gave him fair Words and Hopes at <hi>Vienna;</hi> When the greateſt part of the World believed, That th' Emperor offended not Willingly, but of Ignorance, and that he Was not Ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſily induced to do it, but under the Species of good, and would not oppoſe the Right of the Duke of <hi>Mantoua;</hi> The Governour of <hi>Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lan</hi> ruined the <hi>Montferrat</hi> with an Army, and was within Little of ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king <hi>Caſal</hi> b' intelligence of a Treaty, which he had long practiſed
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:33686:22"/>for the buying of that place; They ſtaid not there, but having hoiſed ſail to the Wind, they were Engaged to purſue their Navigation, and to try the Concluſion of that Courſe with honour which they had begun with ſo little ſucceſs; when they ſaw their ſtroak fail; That the war might be drawn int' a damageable Length and gain in th' End nothing but ſhame and diſpleaſure, the Rewards of unjuſt Enterprizes, when they are not happy; They Cauſed other Mines to play, and preſſed the Duke of <hi>Mantoua</hi> t' Accept a Recompence for <hi>Caſsal</hi> in the <hi>French</hi> County or in <hi>Cremonois,</hi> not Comprehen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding therein the <hi>Citadelle</hi> of <hi>Cremona,</hi> That's to ſay, That an inde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pendent and abſolute Prince, as he Was in his Country, They would have made him in another Countrey their Subject or their Dependent, and offered him in Exchange, a Limited Revenue, and Lands liable to be taken at all hours, for a Soveraignty above price, and a fortreſs al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt Impregnable.</p>
                  <p>And the great preſſures they have ſince made, and th' Extream Heat they have ſince expreſſed to put a value upon the pretences of the Princeſs of <hi>Stigliana</hi> to <hi>Sabionere,</hi> was not to leave her the free diſpoſition of that place, But to keep it under her Name, and to make it ſerve as a Bridle and as a Citadelle to three or four Neighbour-ſtates, in the midſt whereof, 'tis Incloſed; Did they not alſo in a ſtrange Manner protect the Prince of <hi>Monaco</hi> 'gainſt the pretenſions and Deſigns of the <hi>Genoeſe</hi> to that Principality? And in What did that protection at laſt Terminate but in an heavy and ſevere yoak which oppreſſed him, and compelled him to ſhake it off, to caſt himſelf into th' Arms of a more juſt power and more humane domi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation? Such and the like Examples, which I could bring in great Number, make a ſufficient Diſcovery of the Genius of that Nation, and of the boundleſs Avarice, which tranſports them openly to Ceize upon other Mens Lards, or with ſubtilty to Enter upon them by a breach or poſtern gate.</p>

                  <head type="sub">The ſecond Rule which a Prince ought t' obſerve in Relieving of his Friends.</head>
                  <p>THat notwithſtanding, what hath been ſaid; A Prince that undertakes a War for the Love of his Neighbour may Law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully pretend t' a Reemburſement of part of his Charges, If the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon whom he relieves hath ſufficient Means, and may take Cautio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary Towns for the ſecurity of his Disburſements, or for the Retrait of his Troops, or for Engagement of the Faith and Conſtancy of his Neighbour: For truly, 'tis very juſt, That who ſpares not his own blood nor the life of his ſubjects to ſecure his friend from ſervitude, ſhould find Him liberal of the goods and ſubſtance of his ſubjects to
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:33686:22"/>preſerve in ſome ſort his Protector from dammage, and pay willing<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ſome of the Charges for the Remedies that ſave his Life; My mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning is, in Caſe it may Conveniently be done, and that th' eſtate re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieved hath not been ſo much plundred and emptied of victuals and Riches that little remains for life and ſuſtenance, and that the leaſt Emanation would ſerve to make it yield up the Ghoſt and force it to th' Extremity of th' Evil againſt which it took up Arms; Other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe, th' Aid given Would not be ſo much a civil Charity, as the Supercery of a Robber and of a Pyrate. And by killing the ſick per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon to draw away his diſeaſe. When Matters are in that Conditi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, a Prince ought to Content himſelf with the glory that ſhall re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bound upon his Name and Conduct in protecting his Neighbour from oppreſſion, and with the benefits that redound to his ſtates in breaking the deſigns, and hindring the growth of an Ambitious Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter, wh' having devoured the Meaner, would infallibly thruſt at the greater perſons, and reſpects his firſt victories but as Means and brid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges to paſs hikm over to new Conqueſts.</p>
                  <p>I ſay the ſame, and for the ſame Reaſons of thoſe States that have but one fortreſs, wherein all their ſafety Conſiſts and all their hopes; It may be received and kept till th' End of the War, as a bridle and a ſecurity for the faith of him to whom the Relief is given, but not to be r<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

And the Prince ought to ſecure t' his power the Land and goods of his friends Subjects, Whereof he is not Proprietary but the Diſpenſor and Steward, and is bound to huſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>band them with more Circumſpection and retention than his own Lands and Goods.</p>
                  <p>'Tis then an Act of ſingular prudence and a Maxim of ſubtle po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licy to take hold of ſome important place for ſecurity of the Moneys that ſhall be Lent and advanced for th' Affairs of Allyes or Friends; The <hi>Venetians</hi> have often practiſed this prudence, and many good pawns have remained in their hands for Want of Redemption, and and th' Owners have been at laſt Conſtrained to paſs unto them the Revenue and Inheritance. So did Queen <hi>Elizabeth</hi> of <hi>England,</hi> when after the Defection of th' <hi>Hollanders</hi> from their Obedience to <hi>Spain,</hi> ſhe relieved them with Money and Men, and received <hi>Fluſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, Brill</hi> and <hi>Ramachin</hi> in depoſite, till ſhe ſhould be reemburſed of the moneys lent them, which did not happen till the Reign of King <hi>James,</hi> her ſucceſſor, 'Tis to b' ignorant of King-Craft and t' offend ſhamefully againſt th' Art of Reigning, not to demand places for the Retreit of his Troops in caſe of Diſgraces, and to want an Haven for Harbout, when the Wind is Contrary. The Neceſſity of this is En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tire and inevitable, to retain by that Bond, and hold with that An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chor, the Will of them, who are relieved, leſt they Change and
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:33686:23"/>faulter after Engagement, and leave us to the mercy of Winds and Waves, and Accept without our Conſent Advantagious Conditi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons that may be offered them, in fear of our Armes, and to diſingage them from our Allyance. The <hi>French</hi> have often ſtruck againſt this rock for want of Care, and have fallen into theſe Ambuſhes for want of foreſight; It cannot be believed, how often their facility and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſive freeneſs have drawn infidelities and Defection from them, who did not ſeek our Protection or implore our Aid, but t' agree with their Enemies to greater advantage, and to make at our charges and under the ſhadow of our Armes a more Honourable peace. This Unhappineſs happened twice to <hi>Henry</hi> the ſecond, and <hi>Octavus</hi> Duke of <hi>Parma,</hi> whoſe defence the King undertook againſt th' Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perour and the Pope, who would have reduced the Duke to his ſhirt, made his peace with them without his Majeſties knowledge and par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticipation. And in the League which <hi>Henry</hi> made with th' Elector <hi>Maurice</hi> and th' other Confederates of <hi>Germany</hi> againſt <hi>Charls</hi> the fifth; The King having intelligence of their Treaty of Accommoda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and ſeen Evidences thereof, which th' Elector contrived t' our Diſadvantage, was compelled to decline the faults he had begun in accepting of Oſtages, inſtead of Places, and to ceize upon the City of <hi>Mets,</hi> with the conſent of the Biſhop and people, as ſhall be diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covered in the Treaty of Monarchy, for his ſecurity againſt the <hi>Ger<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mans,</hi> who came to fall upon him, and to ſtop the Torrent was ready t' over-flow his Kingdome.</p>
                  <p>The preſent Elector of <hi>Saxe</hi> a moſt Worthy Branch of <hi>Maurices</hi> Blood, and a true ſprout of ſuch a ſtock, did not degenerate from the faith of his Parent; For hee did not onely imitate by the peace of <hi>Prague,</hi> the ſupercery that was done us, at the peace of <hi>Paſſau,</hi> but the Coppy ſurpaſſed th' Original, and without finding ſuch advantagi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous Conditions as th' others were; He did not onely abandon the two Crowns, which had ſpilt ſo much blood, and conſumed ſo great Treaſure for the Liberty of <hi>Germany,</hi> but conſpired againſt them, and Conſented to fight them, who Laboured Earneſtly to Deliver the Captives from the Chains they ſeemed to be in Love with, or to compel them to Happineſs who had not the Courage to be happy; However, 'Tis certain, that the fair peace of <hi>Prague,</hi> wherein th' Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepters of it believed to be ſecure without running the danger of lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing themſelves, as in the Continuation of the War they made to th' Houſe of <hi>Auſtria,</hi> had not been concluded, if the two Crowns had not engaged in th' affairs of that Countrey; And th' Emperor Had not Accorded unto them that reſpite from their ruine, if H' had e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſteemed himſelfe powerfull or happy enough to reſiſt at one Time their forces and Ours; That if th' Intereſſed Perſons are the better for it, and are at ſhelter from the Tempeſt they feared, they d'ow us th' obligation, which they have very ill acknowledged; That if their Peace be Captious and unſetled, as 'tis, and if they have need, as there's no Queſtion of a General peace, which is the ſeal of the Security and
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:33686:23"/>Duration of particular Perſons. 'Tis alſo from the two Crowns, they ought principally to receive that good, and 'tis from them that the Perfecteſt Cure ought to be made of the <hi>German</hi> body, Inſtead of thoſe Lucid Intervalls, which particular Treaties do produce, and of thoſe deceitfull Recoveries which give Eaſe for ſome time to the ſick Perſon; but take not away the Cauſe nor the Root of the Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eaſe. 'Tis for this Reaſon, that they Act with ſo much Conteſt and Heat; that they raiſe ſuch great Armies, and ſupport ſo great an ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pence; and they may be aſſured that Armes will never be laid down till the Work b' Accompliſhed; That they have not made ſo great expences to loſe them; And How painfull ſoever the Cariere be wherein they are ingaged, They will never ſtay till they have paſt through it; And either all Apparences are falſe, or the time is not far off, and <hi>Chriſtendome</hi> will very ſhortly ſee a Diſcovery of the good it deſires, though it have yet ſome Convulſion fits to ſuffer, and the Light it expects, will quickly appear, though it hath alſo ſome ſha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dows to diſperſe, and Clouds to diſſolve.</p>
                  <p>Th' Eaſineſs ſpoken of hath not been pernicious to the <hi>French</hi> a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lone but alſo to the <hi>Dutch;</hi> They have been alſo miſtaken in their March into this Kingdome upon the ſingle faith of its confederates; And if that Prodigious Army of <hi>Reiters</hi> which marched to Over-run our Nation under the Conduct of the Duke of <hi>Bovillon</hi> and the Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ron of <hi>Dona,</hi> had ſurprized ſome ſtrong place; It had not been ſo ill handled, as it was, in its Retrait, nor Feaſted the plains with ſo ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny Dead bodies, as it left there; It had been at leaſt admitted to Capitulation for the ſafety of its Return, and for a part of the Money which had been promiſed in rendring what it held to its Lawfull Maſter.</p>
                  <p>The Queen of <hi>England,</hi> of whom W' have already ſpoken, was much better Adviſed, and her Conduct more prudent, when ſhe would not open her Purſe not Command her Army t' enter <hi>France</hi> in favour of the Prince of <hi>Conde,</hi> Till h' had put <hi>Havre of Grace</hi> into her power, and delivered up that famous Haven, to give her En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trey at pleaſure into this Kingdome. 'Tis true, That I cannot ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſe the pretence, whereby ſhe ſeemed to receive it, nor approve of the Declaration ſhe publiſhed, That it was not to break Amity with the Kings, with whom ſhe deſired t' entertain a good Correſpon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dency, that ſhe had Commanded it to be taken; but to take it out of th' hands of his Rebell Subjects, who might keep it t' his preju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dice, and to Conſerve it for him, during his Minority, and till he might Act perſonally in his Affairs, and hold th' Helm of his ſtate in his own hands, which was handled by perſons who were not, as ſhe ſaid, Prudent enough or Well enough diſpoſed.</p>
                  <p>This Playſter was too groſs, and this Maſque too viſible to Cover and diſguiſe ſo viſible an Uſurpation, and the Councel of the King had reaſon to declare her fallen from the Conditions of the Treaty of <hi>Cambray</hi> in Relation to the buſineſs of <hi>Calais,</hi> ſince ſh' had vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lated
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:33686:24"/>it in aiding the Rebels t' his Majeſty; and that ſh' had been the Receiver of places, which they had taken from him. The Duke of <hi>Savoy,</hi> Grand-father to the preſent <hi>Duke,</hi> endeavoured t' exerciſe the like Charity towards <hi>Henry</hi> the Third, and render the ſame good Office to the Crown, when h' had ſeized upon the <hi>Marquiſate</hi> of <hi>Saluces,</hi> for fear, as He ſaid, leſt <hi>Eſdiguieres</hi> ſhould prevent him, and untill the Troubles, which troubled us, were appeaſed, and that our Civil Tempeſts were allaid. The late King paid him that Charity, as a Debt of the Crown, ſo ſoon as h' attained it, and made him ſee, that Great Princes know how to force Little Princes to b' honeſt in ſpight of their ſubtleties, and t' eaſe them better than any Perſons of the world, of th' Obligation they are under to make Reſtitution of unjuſt Acquiſitions. The Method then ſpoken of, and for the Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons alleged, to require places, hath been at all times familiar with Princes, who know how to Reign, and particularly with the <hi>Spaniards.</hi> But if the Duke of <hi>Parma</hi> demanded no place, the firſt Incurſion he made into <hi>France,</hi> and marched to ſecure <hi>Paris</hi> from th' Armies of the late King, without ſeeking any place of Security for his Retreat, but in the Forces He commanded; it was for a more important Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon; 'twas to blind the world by that ſhew of Liberty; 'twas to leave an Impreſſion that his Maſter ſent him, not to fiſh, as 'tis ſaid, in our Troubles, and to make benefit of our Diſorders, as many mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mured within and without the Kingdom, but onely to drive away Hereſie, or at leaſt t' hinder th' Aſcent of it to the Throne, where none but the True Religion ought to ſit, as He made a ſolemn Oath in the great Church of <hi>Meaux</hi> in the Name of King <hi>Philip.</hi> But he drew not long that breath of Generoſity, and could never be per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwaded to come to the Relief of <hi>Roven,</hi> till the <hi>Fere</hi> was delivered unto him and put into his Cuſtody, which aſſured his Entry into the Kingdom and his going out. As to the reſt, the ſequel of time and courſe of affairs made it appear, that <hi>Philip</hi> made him take a falſe Oath, and had deceived his General to make him deceive others. The Duke of <hi>Seſſa</hi> declared it ſufficiently at <hi>Rome,</hi> when He could not hinder th' Abſolution of the late King, nor his Re-union to th' <hi>Holy Chair,</hi> the Center of the Church; He proteſted againſt it, as prejudicial to the Pretenſions his Maſter had upon <hi>France,</hi> and the Charges expended to conſerve Religion, and expel Hereſie. It was therefore to the <hi>Spaniard</hi> an extraordinary Caſe, and an Exception to their general Rule, which they ſeldom break; as the proceeding of the Duke of <hi>Parma</hi> in his firſt Expedition into <hi>France.</hi> For they have ſuch an unſatiable Appetite after other mens Goods and Lands, and are ſo violently tranſported with that Paſſion, that they have not excepted th' <hi>Holy Chair,</hi> even at ſuch times as they made a ſhew to relieve it. In th' Heat of th' Interdict at <hi>Venice,</hi> and when the Marquis of <hi>Veillane,</hi> Ambaſſador at <hi>Rome</hi> for the Catholick King, had oblig'd the <hi>Pope</hi> to caſt himſelf into th' Hands of his Maſter, and t' accept of his Protection, amongſt the things he demanded of his Maſters be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>half
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:33686:24"/>for the Relief He promiſed him, which was but in Paper, and for that Evidence of Good, which was but in Oſtentation; what He moſt inſiſted upon was, that <hi>Ferrara</hi> ſhould be delivered t' his Maſter for the Retreat of his Army by Land, and <hi>Ancona</hi> for his Army by Sea; and the Count of <hi>Fuentes,</hi> who breathed nothing but Fire and Sword, and was the principal Promoter of the Troubles, had the boldneſs to demand <hi>Charbonnieres,</hi> of the Duke of <hi>Savoy,</hi> who was not interreſſed in the Quarrel, as he ſaid, t' hold the Key of the Paſſage by which <hi>Eſdiguiere</hi> might deſcend to the Relief of the Republique.</p>

                  <p>THis Subject may be wonderfully cleared and beautified by the Relation of the Conduct which hath been obſerved by four different Princes of this Age in the Relief of their Allies. The Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner is very different, though it hath been exerciſed upon the ſame Matter, and in the courſe of the ſame buſineſs, the troubles of <hi>Ger<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>many.</hi> Though there was no Power in <hi>Chriſtendom</hi> unintereſſed in that affair, and that did not repreſent ſome Perſon in that famous Tragedy. 'Tis certain, that the King of <hi>France,</hi> of <hi>Spain,</hi> of <hi>Swede,</hi> and the Duke of <hi>Bavaria,</hi> have appeared in them with more glory than others, and that their Policy was not leſs eminent than their Arms. But ſearch being to be made in the third part into the moſt ſecret Motions, wherewith theſe Princes have acted, and what their Cabinet-Counſels have infuſed, of the moſt particular and remarka<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble conſiderations in that long and ſharp War, I will beſeech the <hi>Reader,</hi> to ſuſpend his curioſity to that Edition, which ſhall follow this immediately. And we ſhall ſee, that <hi>Spain</hi> never moved but upon the ſame foot, and never ſailed but with the ſame Winds of Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bition and Particular Profit; That the <hi>French</hi> motions have been ſometimes Slow and Irreſolute, and ſometimes Quicker, and directed to the General good of the Chriſtian Common-wealth. But that the publick good was always its principal Mark, and th' ultimate End propoſed in its Interventions and Arms.</p>
                  <p>As to the King of <hi>Swede,</hi> He could not truly with better Judgment or Symetry adjuſt the deſign he had formed for the Relief of <hi>Ger<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>many,</hi> and to take off the grievous Fetters th' Houſe of <hi>Auſtria</hi> had impoſed upon it, Th' Innate ſpirit of a Conqueror conſidered, or to make his ſpirit ſerve the Relief under a more ſpecious and plauſible conveniency. Conſider him then in this High and Difficult Exerciſe, from his Landing in th' Haven in the Iſland of <hi>Uſdome</hi> to the Plain of
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:33686:25"/>
                     <hi>Sutzen,</hi> where he loſt his Life without leaving the Victory t' his Enemies, who took his Life from him. The boldneſs of his Treaty with the Duke of <hi>Pomerania,</hi> t' eſtabliſh himſelf in his Country, ſhall be repreſented, the valiant Artifice h' uſed to cauſe <hi>Spomdau</hi> to be put into his hands by the Marquis of <hi>Brandenburge;</hi> And after that <hi>Tilly,</hi> a famous Captain, was entred with ſtrong hand into the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tries of the Duke of <hi>Saxe,</hi> and had promiſed to that <hi>Elector,</hi> unleſs he would be of the Party, t' expound unt' him the myſtical ſenſe of that ſaying, familiar with <hi>Charls</hi> the 5<hi rend="sup">th</hi>, <hi>Wh' is not with m' is againſt me.</hi> Conſider the Prudence the King of <hi>Swede</hi> made uſe of in this oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſion, by raiſing advantage from th' inevitable Neceſſity th' Elector of <hi>Saxe</hi> had of his Virtue and Fortune, againſt ſo fortunate and great a Captain as aſſaulted him.</p>
                  <p>At laſt, after that by gain of the Battel at <hi>Lipſick,</hi> and by the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feat of th' old Troops of the League, H' had forced all th' Obſtacles, and taken away all the Barriers, which hindred to penetrate into <hi>Germany,</hi> and th' Imperial Cities opened unt' him their Gates at conteſt, and the Princes of th' Empire crowded to b' on his ſide; It ſhall be ſeen how he gave them the Law, for whom he gained Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty, and impoſed a kind of yoke, which in time would have become heavy, and began to be born with jealouſie. This kind of Policy truly is not the cuſtom of all Princes, and enters as ſeldom into the Train of th' affairs of the world, as it ariſeth rarely from Conquerors, and from thoſe extraordinary Perſons, who come as the King of <hi>Swede</hi> did, to chnage the face of things.</p>
                  <p>As to the Duke of <hi>Baviere,</hi> this praiſe is not to be denyed him, That being skilful in th' Art of making War, he gave not place t' any Prince of his Age in the Science of the Cabinet Councel; and that <hi>Germany</hi> hath not born of a long time, more dextrous and knowing Perſons, to give Motions to thoſe ſecret Wheels and inviſible En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gines, which ſtir and cauſe to turn, what is moſt Heavy and moſt Immoveable in th' Affairs: And ſince his Art and manner of Acting may be reduced more commodiouſly into Practice, and drawn int' Imitation, than that of the King of <hi>Swedes,</hi> a longer and more parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular ſtay ſhall be made upon his Conduct, than upon that of the King of <hi>Swedes;</hi> and all the Draughts and Proportions for th' Inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction of other Princes and their Miniſters of State; the divers Perſons he perſonated, and the different faces wherewith he diſguiſed him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf t' attain his Ends, and to maintain the poſture gained by his In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duſtry, ſhall be fully diſcovered; how he raiſed himſelf to th' Electorat, and maintained it, notwithſtanding the <hi>Spaniſh</hi> Jealouſie, th' Op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition of <hi>England,</hi> the Contradiction of the Proteſtant Electors, and the Reſiſtance alſo of th' Imperial Conſtitutions.</p>
                  <p>In giving frequent Jealouſies to th' Houſe to <hi>Austria</hi> by th' Hold he ſeemed to take of <hi>France,</hi> and then joyning more ſtrictly with th' Empire, and tying the knot of their Conjunction the ſtronger t' his advantage, H' often prevailed over it; H' holds the power of it
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:33686:25"/>to this day, without being holden by it, and hath ſo blended his In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſts with theirs, that he can ſever them when he pleaſeth, and that he will do, when 'tis no longer good for him, or that it will be better in another place for his affairs.</p>
                  <p>When he was delivered by the death of the King of <hi>Swede</hi> of the greateſt danger h' had run, and of the moſt furious Tempeſt that ever threatned him, He believed, that h' had no cauſe to fear any future ill times, and to ſpeak the truth, ſo long as th' <hi>Engliſh</hi> were content to make Generous Deliberations, and to ſend Magnificent Embaſſies in favour of the <hi>Palatine</hi> Houſe, it would not b' eaſie for that <hi>Duke</hi> to part willingly with what h' had received, not to depart with, but by th' higheſt violence of ill fortune; and the Neceſſity muſt be ſtrong, if he could find no means of delivery from it, and all the Gates ſtrongly ſhut upon him, if he did not eſcape at ſome Poſtern door.</p>
                  <p>As to <hi>France,</hi> to ſpeak again one word thereof, and ſo permit ſome Draughts of her proceedings to paſs by; it ſhall be repreſented entire and wholly, ſuch as it ſtood in the divers occurrences of the Troubles; She will appear in their Birth and Progreſs as Mediatrix of the Quarrel, and Cauſe of the Concluſion of the Peace at <hi>Ulms,</hi> which had re-eſtabliſhed th' affairs of <hi>Germany,</hi> and reſtored to th' Empire its firſt Countenance, If they to whom it ſerved for ſhel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter and plank of ſafety, had not broken it, and oppreſſed by ſurpriſe them, who believing themſelves out of danger by the concluſion of the Treaty, and under the ſhadow of publick Faith, were unpre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pared for defence. Since that time, its action at <hi>Languy,</hi> and its Cares, have been faint in the behalf of <hi>Germany,</hi> and the Cabinet Conteſts, to which the frequent changes of the Miniſters of State did ever con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tribute ſome obſtructions to their reſolutions, and the fire which the factious Religionaries kindled eaſily in its bowels, hindred the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lief, till the <hi>Mantouan</hi> War was ended; then truly it began to return with warm thoughts and cares; and th' Experience gain'd in <hi>Italy,</hi> and the preſent conſtitution of things, having given her t' underſtand, that the Septentrion Wind was onely to b' apprehended in relation t' her ſelf and Allies, She reſolved t' aſſault the Spring of th' Evil, and to ſet, as 'tis ſaid, th' Ax to the root of the Diſorder, and t' act vigorouſly in that behalf, and to make its firſt attempt eminent in the Dyet of <hi>Ratisbonne;</hi> And that as <hi>France</hi> knew to make uſe of th' occaſion of the King of <hi>Swedes</hi> entry into <hi>Germany,</hi> whither the Princes of that Country, ſuffering, or fearing oppreſſion, had call'd him; as ſince of the Treaties that <hi>Charnaſſe</hi> made at <hi>Berwalde</hi> with the King of <hi>Swede,</hi> even to the Renewing of th' Alliance with the <hi>Swedes,</hi> which <hi>Sir</hi> of <hi>Avaux</hi> made the year before at <hi>Hambourge;</hi> ſo ſhe hath t' admiration, and with great dexterity managed two Inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſts. The firſt that moſt poſſeſt her ſpirit, was that of the Church and Holy things, which it eſpouſed with hot and conſtant zeal. Whereupon I dare boldly ſay, that I hope to make it appear, there,
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:33686:26"/>and in other places, <hi>That the true Reaſons of State do not juſtle the Maxims of Religion;</hi> and that the ſame Authority which hath put a diſtinction betwixt the Secular and Eccleſiaſtick Powers, would have them bound up together in Amity, and their hands ſtretched out to th' aid of one another; That a wiſe Prince ought never per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit their Harmony to be broken, nor the bounds, which ſever, to be confounded. In the troubles of <hi>Chriſtendom,</hi> and mixture of Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties of different Religions, which tear it in pieces, the King had not onely the care to put in ſafety the Catholique Intereſts, and to ſecure th' Holy Places and Sacred Perſons, againſt th' Enterpriſes of ſuch men as might have violated them; but his Conduct may be found leſs prudent, ſince for his Love to the Church he'th ſometimes quitted th' advantages, which he might have aſſumed with a good conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, and was firm for the good of Religion in all things, where he might have ſafely taken his Liberty for the good of his Affairs, had he not ſtrongly believed, that the ſmall prejudice he did himſelf would be plentifully repaired by God, who ſuffers not a glaſs of wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter given in his Name to paſs unrewarded; and would not onely ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>company with his Bleſſings the juſtice of his Arms, but alſo crown his Piety and the Paſſion had for the things which relate unt' his Service; And to conſider the Greatneſs and Number of them, which he had undertaken, and the long courſe of Affairs which had enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained him, It may be truly ſaid, That a Proſperity leſs interrupted hath been ſeldom ſeen, nor a Reign that hath received from Heaven more propitious and favourable Aſpects.</p>
                  <p>I dare alſ' affirm a ſecond Truth, which adorns the Kings Reign with a particular Glory, and promiſe to make it out clearly, That w' have not onely made faithful Societies with our Neighbours, but protected th' intereſts of them, whom we were bound to protect; and have exceeded our Limits, and in ſome Caſes, the King may b' accuſed t' have been Indulgent to the Buſineſs of Strangers, and too little ſenſible of the Neceſſities of his Subjects; were it not, that from the Good of his Allies Succeſs, he makes an inevitable refle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction of Good upon his own Affairs, and that in diverting the loſs of his Neighbours, he conſerves the Borders of his Country, and hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders th' Invaſions of his Enemies; And were there no other Reaſons, than that th' Evils and Sufferings of his Subjects might the ſooner de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termine, as the Seeds of a permanent Proſperity, and to re-build the Temple of Peace, which was ſhaken, and trembled for fear of Ruine; it was neceſſary, that the War ſhould precede that Holy and ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mirable Edifice; That in the Tragique and Common Miſery which makes <hi>Christendome</hi> to groan, the King hath this Conſolation, That the Guilty are the ſole Authors of unjuſt Wars, and that the Fire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brands are juſtly puniſh'd, but ſuch are not to be condemned who ſuffer loſſes in the flames. But God and the World know, the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faulters in the Quarrel, which at this day do exerciſe <hi>Chriſtians;</hi> that the King engaged in it as an Aſſiſtant, and if his good Offices and
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:33686:26"/>Prayers had been able to reſiſt the Violence which acted upon his Allies, h' had never drawn his Sword to defend them. And I will ſhew, that although all <hi>Christendom</hi> may witneſs, and his Allies taſte the fruits of his Labours and Charges for their ſafety; ſince He was compelled to procure it by his Arms; He may be blamed with too great a Retention, and with too ſlow a Reſentment for th' In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>juries received in their Perſon, before he could reſolve to repell them by force; He may be blamed, I ſay, for it, if the fear of avoiding and drawing upon his Subjects the Conſequences of a War be blame<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>worthy, or not willingly to deſcend int' an Abyſſe, from whence there's no aſcent at pleaſure, or to take the Flayl of Gods Anger in hand, whoſe ſtroaks fall without diſtinction upon all ſorts of perſons, and ſtrike down equally th' Innocent with the Nocent.</p>
                  <p>The <hi>Reader</hi> will excuſe, if he pleaſe, this light Digreſſion, which may not be diſagreeable to him, and this little Interpoſition, which may give him ſome taſte, and ſerve him for an Eſſay of what is pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pared for him in abundance and bounty in the Sequel of this Work; And that he may judge of th' Equity and Freedom of the King's pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceedings towards his Allies, whom He defends and protects, I will here ſay a word of his Generoſity in the behalf of one of his Neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours, whom h' had obliged t' his Power to be's Friend, wh' hath not omitted any Acts of Hoſtility againſt the King, and to ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der him all proofs of Hatred; and though he was engaged in many formed Conſpiracies againſt <hi>France,</hi> and that it had no ſecret or pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick Enemy, with whom He'd not declared or had Intelligence; and though he was guilty, as all the world knows, of breaking many Treaties, and of many Attempts made againſt <hi>France;</hi> yet ſo ſoon as he made ſhew of Repentance, and t' abjure the contrary Party, the King opened his Arms unto him, and re-eſtabliſhed him in his Eſtates, with exception onely t' a few Fortreſſes, which the King would not commit to the Faith of ſo changeable a Prince, and to the flux and reflux of th' humours that perpetually agitated his Soul; That if this Prince was hardned in th' habitude of failing; and if th' acknowledgment of good received, nor hope of what was pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſed after the War, could retain him in his Duty, nor ſtop his moveable Spirit, there's great cauſe highly to praiſe the Kings Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deration and his magnanimous Spirit, in rendring Voluntarily what he might Lawfully have kept; And there's no cauſe t' accuſe him of Facility and Imprudence, for being deceived, for that he made judgment of the <hi>Duke</hi>'s Conduct by the Law of his Intereſt, as the moſt certain Rule to judge by, that Prudence affords; And there was no reaſon, that a Perſon in good condition, and in a way to be better, ſhould deſtroy himſelf in a capricious humour, and chuſe ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther t' Erre once more at the pleaſure of another, and of Fortune, and float in th' Incertitude of what He might become, than to reſt in a Commodious poſture, and enjoy a Safe condition.</p>
                  <p>Moreover, 'tis of no uſe to diſſemble or to ſpeak but half the
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:33686:27"/>truth; Th' Event contrary the Preſumptions raiſed, though very rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonable, have not deceived the Kings fore-ſight, and the Defection of Duke <hi>Charls</hi> did not ſurprize him, but ſhut up bewixt two Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tremes, to run th' hazard of being deceived, or the reproach of the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jection of him, who did caſt himſelf at his mercy, and implored his clemency, He judged it more honorable for him t' expoſe his Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment to the firſt, than ſecond Hazard, and to convince the world by ſuch an infallible evidence, That he could ſubmit t' any thing in or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der to Peace, and for remove of th' Impediments that did obſtruct it.</p>

                  <head>Ninth Diſcourſe.</head>
                  <head type="sub">Whether it b' Expedient t' hazard the Remains of the Forces of a State, to Recover Reputation lost by ſome Notorious Diſgrace; That 'tis not ſafe t' act alone, or to permit all things to be done b' others in difficult Enterpriſes.</head>
                  <p>THings being thus eſtabliſhed, as they have been in the former Diſcourſes, a Scruple is to be taken away, and a Difficulty cleared, which enters into the Matter to be treated of, Whether to repair the Reputation ruined by ſome infamous diſgrace, and th' Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour abuſed by ſome notorious loſs, The Prince ought t' oppoſe the fortune that oppreſſeth him, and put all his ſtrength to reſiſt the Ruines of the Violence, and t' hazard what remains of the Wrack, rather than conſerve it beaten with ill fortune, and covered with ſhame. That which moſt ſharpens this Scruple, and gives moſt co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lour to this Difficulty, is, That the Reputation of th' Affairs of State ought not to be leſs dear to the Prince, than Honour is t' every Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular honeſt man; And yet, ſince all agree, that the Wiſe as well as th' Ignorant conſpire in this Judgment, that Honour is a Good which muſt be conſerved, when 'tis gained, and recovered when 'tis loſt, at the charges of Life, and that 'tis better to die Honourably than to live Infamouſly; Why ſhould not the ſame Judgment be made upon the Reputation of the State? And will they not believe, That a Prince is obliged to maintain it, and to recover it without any exception of Means, and without reſervation of Lands or Lives?</p>
                  <p>And it may b' obſerved, that the Reputation now to be ſpoken of, is different from the two others, already ſpoken of in the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cedent Diſcourſes, and 'tis of another value, and of another im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portance, than the firſt, whereof mention hath been made, which conſiſts in the ſiniſter Reports ſcattered b' Enemies, and in th' ill ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour they raiſe againſt the glory of a Prince, and to the diſadvantage of his Affairs, which is not, as hath been ſaid, the Subject of a Juſt War; though the like offences done to Particular perſons, and the like ſtains imprinted upon their honour, are but to' often the foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation and original of their Reſentments and Quarrels; which
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:33686:27"/>makes it appear, and I will ſay this by the way, That this ſenſe of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>putation and Honour, wherewith the moſt Excellent Men of all Countries, and of all Ages have been touched, and which they 've not only Authorized by their Precepts, but alſo Confirmed by their Examples, Cannot proceed but from a Spiritual Nature; And this Privilege, which our Soul hath to raiſe it ſelf above the Matter, and to deſpiſe not only the ſenſible objects which flow from it, but Life it ſelf that Depends upon it, to ſubſiſt by that which is not born, but in the thoughts of others, and Conſerved only in their memory, ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficiently ſhews, That ſh' is of a more Exalted Spirit, and hath a fair<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er Birth than the ſouls of Beaſts. To return to th' Objection made, I ſay, that there's a great Diſproportion and a Notable difference be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt th' Honour of a Particular perſon and the Reputation of th' Affairs of State; That in the State, Reputation is a ſubaltern good to the real force, and a Means, which hath for its End the moſt Eſſenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all powers; That this is th' Health of the body, whereof th' other is but the Colour, and that agreeable Light, which appeares without, from the good Conſtitution within, &amp; darts into th' Eyes of the Beholders; And 'tis of the ſame Concernment to a Prince, as I've formerly ſaid, what Credit is to Merchants in order t' effective Riches; And therefore, as what is Superiour in any order is never abandoned for what is Subaltern, nor th' End for the Means, which are Conſtituted for its Accompliſhment; As to deſtroy health for beautifying of the face, and t' hazard all our Lands to maintain our Credit, would be Condemned; ſo a Prince would offend moſt ſhamefully againſt the Laws of Civil Prudence, and be not only a moſt unjuſt diſpenſator, but a very ill Husband of the Powers of the State, to deliver them up wholly to Fortune, and t' expoſe them wholly to th' uncertain and unfaithful Lot of Arms; To ſupport the ſinking Reputation of Affairs, or to raiſe it when 'tis fallen to the ground, all he can do in Gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral, and what he ought to do, if he be dextrous for th' Intereſt of the Reputation of Affairs, 'Tis t' Imprint in Men a great Opinion of his Virtue and Fortune; To give as much as he can Relief and day to the good Succeſſes ſhall befall him; And t' Imitate <hi>Romulus,</hi> whom <hi>Titus Livius</hi> commends for his Admiral Addreſs and Incomparable Grace in giving Value t' all his Actions; And to raiſe it in the leaſt part of his Greatneſs and Power. What Advantages will ariſe to the State from ſuch Apparances dextrouſly managed, and from that light diſperſed Artificially abroad; What great Reſpect and Confidence in Friends theſe ſuperficial things created from Opinion do produce, cannot fully b' expreſſed, and t' Enemies of Reſervation and fear; As of what great Importance 'tis, to ſick States, for preventing th' obſtructions of Recovery, and of Reſtitution t' Health, That it be believed they are in Health, and have alſo Forces for defence againſt Aſſaults, The two Principal parts of the Greatneſs of a State. But when Power and Reputation meet in Conjunction, and that ſome Notable Diminution of th' one, or th' other is to be ſuffered; 'Tis
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:33686:28"/>better endured in the laſt, which may alwayes Spring again, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>take its Glory, ſo long as the firſt ſhall ſubſiſt, but cannot long ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vive the Ruine of th' other; nor ſtay long above ground after its fall; And truly, 'tis not a New thing or Extraordinary to ſee Viciſſitudes in the Reputation of Princes and States; There's nothing more fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quent in the World, and there was never State that hath not ſuffered ſome Eclipſe, and been Aſſaulted with ſome Ill ſucceſs, that hath in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terrupted the Courſe of his Glory; But there may be a Reſurrection when the Fall is on that ſide; A ſpot Imprinted in the Reputation of Affairs, is not a Spot that cannot be taken out; The firſt Conſidera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble good Fortune that happens doth Efface it; And a Tree, which Winter hath ſtript of its Leaves, and left Naked, renews in Beauty and Flouriſheth, as before, if it thruſt out other Leaves.</p>
                  <p>But it ſeems that ſome Corruption is permitted in that part, That a fairer Generation may put forth; And 'tis certain, that the Glory, of the <hi>Romans,</hi> was Livelier and more Entire, in that the Victory, after the loſs of three Battails, and the ſight of <hi>Hannibal</hi> at the Gates of <hi>Rome,</hi> remained unto them upon the <hi>Carthaginians,</hi> than if they 'd ſtopt them upon the Borders of <hi>Rhone,</hi> or at th' Entry of th' <hi>Alpes.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The Defeat of <hi>Quintilius Varus</hi> by th' <hi>Almans</hi> was not ſ' infamous to the Reign of <hi>Auguſtus,</hi> as the Revenge which <hi>Germanicus</hi> took, was honourable to the Reign of <hi>Tiberius,</hi> The Virtue of the Repub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lique of <hi>Venice,</hi> was more admired, and did Dart out fairer Rayes, in their Return from the greateſt ſtroak it received at <hi>Gyradade,</hi> Than if it had not received it; and in riſing to its Ancient greatneſs, than if it had not fallen. And without flattering of the Kings Reign, and the preſent Adminiſtration, It may be ſaid, That if it hath ſometimes hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned, yet but rarely, that ſome ſmall ſtorm of Diſgrace hath fallen up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the Long Proſperity that accompanied his Armes; And if the Commanders have not alwayes Happily Commanded them; For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune hath ſo ordained it, as well to conſerve by thoſe high Accidents the Right ſh' hath upon all humane Actions, As to make the power of the State the better to be known, which was not ſhaken by ſha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kings that had overthrown other States; And to make the Prudence, the Boldneſs, and Activity of the Conduct of the King and of his Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſters of State t' appear with the more Luſtre and Glory; who al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wayes made th' advantages the Common Deſtiny of War had given them, unprofitable to th' Enemies; who alwayes cut off the Wings of their Victory, and hindred them from Flying over the Limits of the ſame Field, where they gained it; And have ſo ſhut it up in the midſt of a great Number of Good ſucceſſes that preceded and fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed on our part, That it may be ſaid in ſome ſort, that it hath Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>appeared and vaniſhed away, as if there had been no Victory. Before handling of th' other branch of Compariſon propoſed in the begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning of this Diſcourſe, which is the ſenſe of Particular Perſons in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation to their Honour; Two other very Important Maxims ſhall b'
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:33686:28"/>added to what hath been already ſaid in Relation to the Reputation of the State ; The firſt, That there are ſome points of Reputation Ambiguous, or Conteſted, and ſome Delicacies of Honour not ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficiently Cleered, or which are Called in Queſtion, whereupon a Prince or his Miniſters of State ought not to Conteſt opinionately, nor to debate Violently, when there's no Queſtion then made of it, and that ſome Affairs are to be Treated and Concluded, As a Peace, an Alliance of bloud, or a League, &amp;c. For then Endeavours muſt b' uſed to ſlide upon them with Dexterity, and handle thoſe Thorns without pricking the Fingers. Queen <hi>Elizabeth</hi> of <hi>England</hi> did the like upon the Conteſt that hapned at <hi>Bolognia,</hi> betwixt the <hi>Spaniſh</hi> Ambaſſadour and Hers, for the Precedency. Th' Expedient found was to Treat by Writing, and by Propoſals, and Reciprocal Anſwers. The ſame Moderation was obſerved in the Conference of <hi>Vervins</hi> betwixt or Ambaſſadours and thoſe of <hi>Spain,</hi> Ours were lodged there in ſuch a Manner, that w' had reaſon to believe, That the Right, Juſtice and the Preſcription of Time out of mind had given us, was preſerved unto us, and there remained to the <hi>Spaniards</hi> ſome Appa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance and ſhadow, I know not what, t' hide and Cover the Diſad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage they had received in th' unjuſt Pretenſion that torments them upon that Subject, and entred into their Spirits with the deſign of U<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niverſal Monarchy.</p>
                  <p>But when there's no Cauſe to paſs beyond it, or to labour for ſome Treaty neceſſary to the publique good; Great Care muſt be taken of the Byaſſed Men, and to loſe Nothing of thoſe Rights in matters of Importance; The Dignity of the State muſt not directly or obliquely be put to Reference, nor a Pretenſion of Equality admitted where the Superiority hath been gained. Such was the practice of <hi>Pibrac</hi> and <hi>Ferrier</hi> at the Council of <hi>Trent,</hi> who choſe rather to Retire than t' Aſſiſt at a Ceremony, where Precedency before the <hi>Spaniſh</hi> Ambaſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dour was not fully Accorded unto them, nor their Dignity ſufficient<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly acknowledged; And at the Wedding of the King of <hi>Denmarks</hi> Son ſome years paſt, <hi>Sir</hi> of <hi>Avaux</hi> the Kings Ambaſſadour to that Grown, Prudently Rejected and without Reſerve, All the propoſed Means that left in the leaſt Jealouſie the Precedency claim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by him without Difficulty and Modification, above the <hi>Spaniſh</hi> Ambaſſadour.</p>
                  <p>It muſt not therefore be forgot here; That there are ſometimes lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle Delicacies and Formalities of Nothing, whereon th' Agents of Princes our friends do ketch, and for which they cauſe Diſorders; And are the Cauſe, that whilſt they amuze themſelves in the Cleer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and Debating of them, much time is loſt to the prejudice of th' Affairs of their Maſters. And that the ſecret Acrimonies which have taken Root in th' Hearts of thoſe Agents, hold them alwaies di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vided, and occaſion, that a good and ſincere Correſpondence is ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver formed amongſt them; That fierce and proud Spirits are ſubject to fall into theſe Inconveniencies, and particularly, when they begin t'
<pb n="48" facs="tcp:33686:29"/>Act, and at th' Entrey to their Imployments, they will publiſh it by ſome thing of Noiſe, and to gain Reputation by ſome Novelty, that obligeth the World to turn their Eyes towards them, and to ſpeak of their Adminiſtration; But the Dextrous and Wiſe Men will divert, as much as may be, thoſe ſtones of Offence, and avoid them, againſt which their Fortune may break and make Shipwrack; And to ſpeak generally, they ought not t' Engage, if it may b' avoi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded with Honour, their Maſters in any Trouble, but Conceive that they have buſineſs enough on Foot without making of New mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters, and Quarrels enough that ariſe from th' Incounters and mix<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of things they do Manage, without th' Interpoſition of any Evil Humours, or of th' Imprudent or Undiſcreet Conduct of their Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>baſſadours.</p>
                  <p>The ſecond Maxim is, That the Love of a great Reputation, or the deſires of great Profits, ought not ſo ſtrongly to Poſſeſs or Tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port us, as in Difficult and Long Enterpriſes t' act All for to gain All; And t' admit of no Companion; To be free from ſharing the Glory of the Succeſs, or to Divide with any Perſon the Conqueſt, which they would reſerve to themſelves. On the Contrary, It ought ever to be Conceived, That in th' Affairs of Great Importance too much Safety cannot b' uſed to make their Buſineſs proſper, or too many work-Men hyred to fix a Deſign, a thouſand unexpected Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cidents may Croſs, and which Fortune hath a thouſand Inventions to Deſtroy, and to Convert into ſmoak. I ſhould never finiſh, if I did report all th' Experiences the World hath made, and all th'Exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples Hiſtory relates of this Important Truth; There's no need of go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing from the preſent Time, nor from th' Affairs of <hi>Europe,</hi> to find out Lively and Senſible Inſtances; There's before our Eyes, what paſſed this year in <hi>Germany,</hi> which cannot be Newer; And to go a little high<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er, if after the death of the King of <hi>Swede,</hi> and the Loſs of that Incom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parable Prince, from whoſe Diſcipline did iſſue no leſs Famous Cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains, nor in leſs Number, than from the Diſcipline of <hi>Alexander</hi> the Great, The <hi>Swedes</hi> had Acted with <hi>France</hi> in better Correſponden<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy, Their good Succeſſes which began to Decline in <hi>Alſatia</hi> by the raiſing of the Siege of <hi>Conſtance,</hi> and Blocking up of <hi>Briſac,</hi> had not expired at <hi>Nortlinghen;</hi> And it had not been reſtored to the point of Elevation, where 'tis ſeen, without the perfect Intelligence now Entred into with this Kingdom. I paſs by that Inordinate ſenſe which ſtrikes the perſons of Courage to a contrary Apprehenſion, whereof the Wiſe are ſometimes ſick by too much Prudence; and the beſt way to draw the Figure of a Virtue perfectly, and to repreſent it to the Life, is to Conſider that ſhe is lodged betwixt two Extremes, and to be drawn by th' Oppoſition of two Contraries where ſhe Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fines.</p>
                  <p>There are Princes then to be found, who for ſtaying too long from Declaring for a Party in Communication of Intereſts and Fortune, and in Contenting themſelves by giving a ſecret Heat and a faint and
<pb n="49" facs="tcp:33686:29"/>oblique aid, ſee them at laſt fall; Whence it falls out, That they are bound t' oppoſe themſelves alone to the progreſs of the Contrary party, and to the courſe of a Proſperity difficult to reſtrain, as t' hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der th' Over-running of all that ſhould oppoſe it, and to ſtop its Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petuoſity and Violence; This truly happens but too often; but if from the beginning, and when the forces of both parties were ballan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced, They had Joyned theirs, to them they favoured in ſecret and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der-hand, There's no Queſtion but they had Carried it, and had made the Ballance to fall on the ſide they deſired to have it fall.</p>
                  <p>I will explain my thoughts by a Memorable example. A conſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racy was formed ſome years paſt by the Barons of the Kingdome of <hi>N<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>ples</hi> againſt <hi>Ferdinand</hi> th' Old and the Duke of <hi>Calabria</hi> his Son, who acted Jonytly with his Father in the Government of that Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try; The Duke of <hi>Lorrain</hi> by Reaſon of the pretenſions he had upon that Kingdome, and the Pope to whom th' Ambition of thoſe two Princes was in Jealouſie, and their greatneſſe odious, Joyned in the Conſederacy. The Republique of <hi>Venice</hi> wounded with the Popes paſſion, and whom th' <hi>Arragons</hi> apprehended as the greateſt obſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cle and ſtrongeſt Barrier to the Deſignes they had in <hi>Italy,</hi> would not, nevertheleſs, Embarque with the Barons of the Kingdome, nor Enter into the League with the Confederate Princes, but made Choice of a Temper, which proſpered not, and of a middle Way, that at laſt was fatal unto <hi>Venice.</hi> The Republique diſcharged from their ſervice <hi>Robert of Saint Severin,</hi> a Captain of great Name and of great Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit, and a part of thoſe Troops, which ſhe ſuffered him to take, and ſome Money ſhe gave him under-hand to pay them, and t'hinder that great body of Men of War to diſſolve till the Republique had taken party. I will ſay, on this occaſion, That 'tis to be ſeen from hence, That this manner ſo much in uſe in making War, without declaring of it, and t' exerciſe Acts of Hoſtility, under the Vizard of Newtral Perſons, Is not an Invention of theſe modern dayes, nor an Artifice peculiar to th' Houſe of <hi>Auſtria,</hi> though they make uſe of it more than any other Princes; But it Comes from an Ancienter Date, and deſcends from an higher and older ſpring. In this Equipage then, and with this Maſque, <hi>Saint Severin</hi> offered his ſervice to the Pope, by order from the Republique, and was ordained chief Commander of th' Armies of the Church, and Principal Director and firſt Inſtrument of that War. But that which uſually happens to the greateſt part of Leagues, ſpecially, when they are Compoſed of weak Numbers, hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned to this; <hi>Lorraines</hi> Army marched late in th' year and out of ſea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, during which Time the Forces of the Barons and of the Pope were ill handled, <note place="margin">Innocent. 8.</note> and th' Activity uſed by the Duke of <hi>Calabria</hi> in his March to find his Enemies, who were not half Ready nor Well drawn together, and the good ſucceſs he had againſt <hi>Saint Severin,</hi> who left in that War a part of the Reputation gained in many others, ſuddenly untied that Chain and broke that League. The Pope was
<pb n="50" facs="tcp:33686:30"/>very glad t' hear of an Accomodation, which was deſired with heat by th' <hi>Arragons</hi> and the Barons, except the Prince of <hi>Saleme,</hi> who ſtood inflexible, even in ill Fortune, and choſe rather to quit the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome, than to Live under a Domination he hated, though others Laboured to return to the good Graces of the King and of the Prince.</p>
                  <p>The <hi>Venetians,</hi> obſerving that th'Effort of that League againſt th' <hi>Arragons</hi> had ſerved only to make them the more powerfull, and that th'Engines framed t' over-throw, had re-inforced them, knew the Fault they had Committed in not being of the party, and after an un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſucceſsfull ſolicitation of the Pope and of the Duke of <hi>Lorrain</hi> to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>new it, did reſolve t' oppoſe ſingly the growth of <hi>Ferdinands</hi> power and of his Sons, and to put a Bridle to th' Ambition of thoſe Princes which did over-flow without Meaſure.</p>
                  <p>This Conſideration now repreſented, invites me t' another, which is not far off, and may b' annexed without Violence, That there are alſo ſome Princes, who loving too much their Eaſe, or fearing too much the Charges, will alwaies ſtand Newters betwixt two parties, that make War, and be immoveable ſpectators of their Actions; Though they have a Conſiderable Intereſt, That th' one fall not, and that th' other become not the Maſter. The Reaſons wherewith theſe Princes, whom I ſuppoſe powerfull, do ſupport their Judgments, and flatter their Proceedings, are theſe; That if the party who Labours for their Intereſts receives ill Entertainment from Fortune, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comes aſſaulted with ſome great Diſgrace, They ſhall come in time to relieve him, and that with the ſcattered pieces of their Over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>throw, which muſt be Conſiderable, and with his freſh and Entire forces, ſhall not only make the Counterpoile of th' Enemies powers, aw<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  <p>This truly, hath ſome ſhew of good ſenſe, and is a ſpecious Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner that hath Cheated ſome Politiques, who practiſe or Counſell it; As for me, I cannot Apoprove of it, and what Colour of profit at firſt ſight, it preſents, or flaſh of Prudence it may Caſt, 'Tis Certain that it ordinarily Conceals the Motions and Principles of a great fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture Ruine, and hides Evils, which do not appear, and are not diſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered, but when there's ſcarce any Remedy; for, as 'tis, a kind of In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>juſtice, and ſeems to juſtle the General Law of the World, to deſire Goods without giving any thing for them, and to participate of the fruits of another mans pains and expences, without laying out any
<pb n="51" facs="tcp:33686:30"/>labours or Charges for them, They, who build upon that Founda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and feed themſelves with the Fancy, That they can ſtop when they pleaſe the fury of a Victorious party, have not well Conſidered the Condition of the Conquered, and the Sequel of a Victory; They do not remember, That they are but the Leven of affrights and Conſternations, which infect all that mingle with them; And that a Generall Victory, if it be not forced to languiſh, but purſued with force and diligence, reſembles a Torrent, which makes a Precipice, having forced its reſiſtance, and to the Sea that over-flows, when it hath broken its banks. I leave it to the Judgment of theſe two Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian powers, wh' have ſtood Immoveable to this time, and have aided only, as a ſpectacle prepared for ſight, To what hath been done ſince in <hi>Germany</hi> and in <hi>Italy,</hi> If they with whom th' Houſe of <hi>Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stria</hi> had to do in that Countrey had fallen, They had been in a ſtate t' have re-eſtabliſhed them, and t' have taken the Burthen of Rui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned and Caſt affairs upon them. It muſt truly b'avowed, That the Conſtitution of th'humane ſpirit, is ordinarily ſo Weak and of ſo ſoft a Metall, that it unwillingly reſolves t' enter upon difficult En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terprizes though they be neceſſary, or when it enters timely hath not the Conſtancy to preſevere, and wants Breath to go to th' End and finiſh the Courſe.</p>

                  <head type="sub">Of the difference betwixt th' Honour of Particular perſons, and the Reputa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of States, And whether the Prince be Master of th' Honour as of the Life and Lands of his Subjects when Publique Neceſſity requires it.</head>
                  <p>LEts Come now to th' Honour of Particular perſons, and to that ſort of Reputation, which is raiſed in th' opinion of Men, above all, that the greatneſs of Fortune can give, and the Matter and objects of the Senſes, as moſt Acceptable can contain. By honour, I do un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtand, the glory which redounds, and the perfume exhaled from th' Exerciſe of Probity and of th' other duties of every particular Condition, which leave in the ſpirits of Men a good Impreſſion, and an high eſteem of him, who doth practiſe them. 'Tis the Civil life, excluſive to Beaſt, and whereby the Reaſonable Creatures have a ſtrong Inclination, and a violent Inſtinct to Live and t'Ennoble their ordinary and natural Being. This kind of life, as formerly obſerved, hath been in all times the paſſion of great perſons, who have not only preferred it to Pleaſure and Riches, but even to the Natural Life. The reaſon of this difference is; That Honour, being of th' Appur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenances of Virtue and of her ordinary Train, partakes of the Digni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of her Principle, and takes an Impreſſion and Tincture of the ſame order with her, and of a Superiour value t' all that can be exalted in
<pb n="52" facs="tcp:33686:31"/>th'Empire of Fortune, and t'all that can b' attractive in the womb of the World.</p>
                  <p>I have ſaid, that Honour is of th'Appurtenances and Train of Virtue, becauſe there's not a Nation of ſo dull and groſs intelli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence, and of ſo barbarous and barren manners, that eſteems not th'Actions of Probity, and commends thoſe inviolable duties, which no Legiſlator invented, nor any particular Right hath re-eſtabliſh'd; but a common Nature, and an univerſal Law have ordained to be rendred to God, to our Neighbour, and t' our ſelves; That, if in the corruption of the Manners of Society, and in th'unjuſt diſtribu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of Recompence and of Puniſhment, Honeſt Men are loaden with ſhame, and the Wicked with glory; That Crowns are ſet up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on th' Heads of Criminal perſons, and Thunder broken upon inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cent Lives; It doth not happen by a publick confeſſion, or open profeſſion made to diſgrace Virtue, and give honour to Vice; to judge Vice worthy of Eſteem and Veneration, and Virtue of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proach and Ignominy; But that in effect, The Colours of th'one and of th'other are diſguiſed and falſifi'd, and their Enſigns tranſpoſed; That in making War to Virtue, they ſeem to purſue Vice with violence, and to do honour to Virtue, when their labour is to erect Statues and Trophees to her Adverſary; but there's no example that the moſt unlimited Licenſe, or the moſt imprudent Calumny of the world ever dared t'aſſault Virtue in her Name, and under Her Figure, or to procure it pain or ſhame.</p>
                  <p>Wherefore, ſince Virtue hath ſo much Dignity and Elevation, and that in this life 'tis th'Ultimate End of Man, and Crown of the Faculties and Operations of the Soul; 'Tis no marvel, if Men are not onely taken with her beauty, and the form that conſtitutes her, but are ſo ſenſible alſo of what toucheth th' outſide, and is called <hi>Honour,</hi> that they prefer it t'all, that is not of its Order and Claſſis, and had rather ſuffer Natural Death, than permit the Civil Life to be wounded.</p>
                  <p>The Reputation of States, is not the ſame, whereof ſo often hath been ſpoken, and it proceeds not from ſo pure a Spring, and hath not ſo noble a Birth, as th'Honour of Particular perſons: Virtue is not the ſole Cauſe, as of th'other; The greatneſs of Succeſſes, from whence it ariſeth, is no leſſe the work of Fortune, than an effect of the Merits of Men; Princes are as formidable for being happy, as for being Valiant; And ſome Pagans have affected particular Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merces and ſecret Communications with ſome Divinity, to make their Victories the more eaſie by that belief; And 'tis certain, That th'Honour of Particular perſons is preſerved many times from the Wrack, which falls upon the Reputation of Publick Affairs. <hi>Hani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bal</hi> loſt nothing of the name of a Great Captain, when he was over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come by <hi>Scipio,</hi> though the Glory of <hi>Carthage</hi> was extinguiſhed by that diſgrace; The Prince of <hi>Conde</hi> marched full of Honour out of the loſt Battel of St. <hi>Quintins,</hi> where ſo great a Breach was made upon
<pb n="53" facs="tcp:33686:31"/>the dignity of the French Crown; And th'Admiral of <hi>Chastillon</hi> boaſted, a few days before th' Execution on St. <hi>Bartholomew</hi>'s day, That he had that Advantage of <hi>Alexander,</hi> and of <hi>Julius Caeſar,</hi> That the loſs of four Battels, which had ruin'd or much weakn'd the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>putation of his Party, had not diminiſh'd the leaſt of His Reputation. The proportion that may be found, and th' Adjuſtment to be made betwixt the Reputation of States, and th'Honour of Particular per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons conſiſts in this, That as the firſt is but th' Opinion derived, and the noiſe ſpread of their greatneſs and power, in the ſpirits of Stran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers; The ſecond alſo is but th' Impreſſion received, and the fair Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſentation made of the Virtue and Merits of others; And again, as the Reputation of States, is leſs Conſiderable than the power, from whence 'tis derived; That the honour of Particular perſons, is infe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riour alſo in dignity to the Virtue, that is its principle; which carries me to a Conſideration a little alienated from my Subject, but no ſtranger to it, That there's not any corruption which hath ſo ſtrongly ceized upon Mankind, nor diſorder, which doth more univerſally diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>figure, than this; That though there be but a Few perſons in the world, truly Virtuous, and that acquit themſelves faithfully of the duties of their condition; yet there are none, but would paſs for men of Honour, and are offended when they are accuſed for ſuch, as they know themſelves to be, and if Falſe Evidences are not given in their favour.</p>
                  <p>Since we are thus far engaged in this matter, and entred into ſo fair a Field as that of <hi>Honour;</hi> it will not be amiſs to make ſome pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſs, and t'agitate a difficulty upon this ſubject, eminent in the Politicks; Whether Princes are as well Maſters of th' Honour of their Subjects, as of their Lands and Lives; And whether they have a Right to make them appear Culpable of ſome crimes, though Innocent, and to charge infamous diſgraces upon their Reputation, though but a few perſons are guilty of them, to diſcharge, from thoſe crimes, the Princes Reputation, of ſo great importance to ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny perſons. In th'Affair of <hi>Antonio Perez,</hi> which gave ſo great trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to <hi>Philip</hi> the Second, and made of great a noiſe over all <hi>Europe; Diego Chavez</hi> Confeſſor to <hi>Philip,</hi> judged it expedient to ſacrifize th'Honour and the Perſon alſo of <hi>Perez</hi> to ſhame and torments, to ſave the King's Honour, and to divert the dangerous conſequences, which would have reſulted againſt the State, if they believed him th'Author of th'Aſſaſſinate, executed by his order, and by the dire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction of <hi>Perez,</hi> on the perſon of <hi>Eſcovedo,</hi> Secretary to <hi>Don John</hi> of <hi>Austria.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>This opinion nevertheleſs, ſeems not to me to be ſufficiently grounded or coloured; And there's reaſon, that although th'Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity of a Prince over his Subjects be very large, and much dilated, yet not infinite, and receives exceptions, which limit th'extent of it; And as 'tis certain, that a Prince hath not a Right t'oblige his Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects to violate the Laws of Probity, and to become Perjur'd, Sacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>legious,
<pb n="54" facs="tcp:33686:32"/>or Adulterers; ſo 'tis probable, that he hath not a right to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire them to diſgrace their Name, and to defame their Memory with diſhonour that ariſeth from Crimes, much leſſe t'expoſe them, for the ſalvo of his own Reputation, to puniſhments and torments, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with Criminals are puniſh'd; As <hi>Perez</hi> was expoſed by th'advice of <hi>Philip</hi>'s Confeſſor. I conceive alſo, as 'tis unlawful for a King to for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bid his ſubjects for any cauſe the duties of Probity, and th'exerciſe of neceſſary Virtues; ſo 'tis not permitted him, to deprive thoſe Virtues of their eſteem, being their firſt and natural Recompenſe, or to take from them the Lights that guide them, and the Beauty that adorns them, and gives them new graces t'improve their value, and to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>get in others a greater Love and Induſtry. The foundation of my opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion is this, That Soveraigns have ordinarily no other power over their Subjects, than what their Subjects have transferred unto them; nor Right, but ſuch as Soveraigns have received from them; 'tis pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bable, they did not intend to deliver up unto them the diſpoſition of their Honour, as they ſubmitted unto them their Lands and Lives; nor to diſſeiſe themſelves, for the Love of Princes, of that fair Poſſeſſion and rich Inheritance, which they derive and gather from their Virtue; 'Tis confirmed by this Conſideration, which ſeems to me de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finitive, That the Goods and Lives of the People being committed to the protection of Soveraigns, and laid up in the benefits of the protection they owe unto their Subjects, and obligations to watch for their ſafety, and to preſerve them from the Uſurpations of cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tous men, and from the force of violent perſons; it was very juſt, that to acquit themſelves of that Duty, and fill up that Obligation, they ſhould be armed with the ſtrength of particular perſons, and aided with their riches, that it might be in his power t'imploy a part of them to conſerve the reſt, and t'expoſe a few lives for the ſecurity of a great number of perſons.</p>
                  <p>But 'tis not the ſame with the true Honour of Man, and with that juſt Eſteem, which accompanies naturally th' exerciſe of Probity, and th'other neceſſary duties of every condition; as it hath no need of the Soveraigns Authority to conſerve it, but of the Cauſe that produce it, and is no more ſubject to the violence of a Tyrant, than to th'Empire of a juſt Prince, and whithout the intervention of the Laws, as having Laws that ordained it; 'Tis not, I ſay, a marvel, if for that conſideration, as it enters not into th'End of th' Inſtitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of Soveraigns, ſo 'tis not compriz'd under th'extent of their Power, and they have no right to ſacrifize it to publick neceſſity, as the Lands and Lives of their Subjects, whoſe protection and ſafeguard they have undertaken, and ought of ſecure it unto them.</p>
                  <p>In purſuance of this, it may be demanded, Whether Particular perſons ought to abandon their Honour for the Publick Intereſt, and permit it to be ſullied by ſome villanous diſgrace, to ſave the Princes honour, and the Reputation of Affairs; This difficulty, I avow, ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pears to me ſo great, that I dare not undertake to decide it, and that
<pb n="55" facs="tcp:33686:32"/>on both ſides I ſee ſo many Reaſons, and to ſuch equal force, that they ballance my underſtanding, and hinder me to take a Side; but I will onely ſay here, That I have admired in th' Inſtructions, the Marquis of <hi>Bedemar,</hi> ſince called Cardinal of <hi>Cueva,</hi> left to <hi>Lewis Brave,</hi> appointed his Succeſſor to th'Embaſſie at <hi>Venice;</hi> That amongſt other things, the Cardinal doth adviſe him, That to render himſelf the more Acceptable to the <hi>Venetians,</hi> and t'inſinuate the more readily into their underſtandings, provoked againſt him and the Duke of <hi>Oſſona,</hi> by reaſon of <hi>Renauts</hi> Conſpiracy, whereof the <hi>Venetians</hi> believed them th' Authors; That the better to gain their belief, he ſhould make no difficulty to diſſemble and approve of their Reſentment, or to Charge them with the malice of that deſign, and with th'hatred of that Attempt, to diſcharge the King his Maſter of it; And that he ſhould endeavour it by private inſtructions, after great proteſtations made of the <hi>Cardinals</hi> and of the Duke of <hi>Oſſona</hi>'s innocency, and after a ſubtil and artifical diſcourſe, to ſhew, that that Conſpiracy was but a dream and a ſtratagem the Senate of <hi>Venice</hi> forg'd t'afright the people, and to make them ſuffer with more eaſe the Subſidies and Impoſitions they did intend to charge on them, and whereof they had need, to continue the War, they made to th'Archduke <hi>Ferdinand,</hi> and to the Duke of <hi>Oſſona.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>In favour of this counſel, it may be ſaid, which ſeems ſo generous, and hath ſo plauſible an appearance, That if the Marquis of <hi>Bedemar</hi> was innocent, as he would have perſwaded it, and as piouſly it may be believed; He knew, that it would be very eaſie for him to clear that blot, and that Time, the Father of Truth, and which draws to light the things that Ignorance or Malice have hid, would have cured the world of that Error and ill Impreſſion conceived againſt him; That if it otherwiſe hapned, and that he continued, as the <hi>Ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>netians</hi> did report, culpable in the publick opinion, It would have been but of thoſe Illuſtrious Crimes, that ambitious men take for Virtues, and which the Reaſon of State, that permits th'Acting of the Worſt to its declared or ſecret Enemies, doth authorize and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compence. 'Tis true, that the <hi>Spaniards,</hi> to whom the Reaſon of State is not unknown, lookt upon the <hi>Venetians</hi> at that time as their Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies, by reaſon of the War they had with th'Arch-duke of <hi>Gre<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

To make yet a little further progreſs into this Matter, and to raiſe ſome Judgment upon it, becauſe a clear ſight and cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainty cannot be had of it; I will onely ſay, That if the Conſpiracy whereof the Queſtion is, was not true, as the <hi>Spaniards</hi> did main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain it, That it had colour enough to diſpoſe the Republique to the puniſhment was executed upon them, whom it believed culpable; For t'imagine, as the Marquis of <hi>Bedemar</hi> hath publiſhed it, that it was but a half Alarm which they raiſed to their Subjects, and a Fancy the Republick formed to make them afraid, for the Reaſons he ſuppoſed; And that being a Queſtion of fact, it was of difficult proof, and of hard diſcovery; <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>he belief, it may be, if there had been no more, would not be impoſſible; but that to gild th'Artifice the better, and to give the fairer colour to the deceit, the Republick had cauſed ſome perſons to be put to death, and in an extraordinary manner, whom they knew to be Innocent, whereof I cannot be per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwaded; And 'tis more probable, that two particular perſons, as the Duke of <hi>Oſſona</hi> and the Marquis of <hi>Bedemar,</hi> the firſt whereof plaid always with Religion and Conſcience, as all the world knows, and th'other hated the <hi>Venetians,</hi> from whom he believing to t'have re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived ill entertainment, compoſed that Fable, and not that a whole great Body, as the Senate of <hi>Venice,</hi> wherein are many perſons of wiſdom and eminent Virtue, would conſent to ſo wicked a pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding.</p>
                  <p>To conclude, ſince men hazard their Virtue and Conſcience ſo often for humane Intereſts and ſubaltern hopes; ſince men do as the ſimple Inhabitants of the New World, who proſtitute their Gold and Silver, for Glaſs and for old Rings; 'Tis not to be wondred, if ſometimes, upon the like occaſion, Honour be expoſed, which is but an acceſſion of Virtue and good Conſcience, chiefly, when that proſtitution is covered with ſo ſpecious a cloak, as that of the Princes Service, and the good of his Affairs; In all times, it hath been the lot of the Court, to poiſon men, if not with the profeſſion, at leaſt with the practice of diſhoneſt Maxims, which ruine Honour and Virtue, to gain Goods and Power. Few long-livers in Court ſecure them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves
<pb n="57" facs="tcp:33686:33"/>from the Temptations; and Reaſon hath need of a particular Grace, and of an extraordinary Relief, to reſiſt the force of Objects, which continually beſiege the Senſes, and the multitude of Exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples, which from all parts aſſault it. The Luſtre raiſed by Luxury, makes Riches, as th'Aliment to be beloved; And the Reverence ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred to Power, makes it to be ſought for with ſo much heat, and conſerved with ſo much pain: And as men fall not ſuddenly into the bottom of Evil, but deſcend by degrees into it; ſo they, who pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſue theſe things, or enjoy them, accuſtom themſelves by little and little to make it their Soveraign Good, and t'eſteem all other things which ſerve not to this End, for vain and ridiculous.</p>
                  <p>But this determines not, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

However, the Faith of Courtiers, who are ſo vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lently taken, and deſperately poſſeſſed with the deſire of making their Fortune, That there's no treachery they will not do, nor baſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs they will not act for the love of them, from whom they expect it, ought always to be much ſuſpected; And there's great cauſe of diſtruſt, that ſuch perſons, worſhipping onely the Power men have of doing good, will change their Affections with the change of Maſters, and fail of Acknowledgments when they fail of Hopes; And 'tis that diſtruſt, which in my opinion is th'original of a Maxim, which is but too familiar with great Princes; T'hold always the leſs conſiderable perſons, that are uſeful unto them, by the bands of that paſſion; And to cheriſh them, who ought to be conſerved, by not doing for them all the good at once they do intend them. But if Men of Honour, they will always have a condign gratitude for their Benefactors, and will raiſe no Hopes, if able Men, upon them that are in power, but look upon the things of the Court, as the things of the World, the fulleſt of Incertitude, and to reſemble Lotteries, where for one Prize there are fifty Blanks.</p>

                  <p>AFter the making of ſo great a Circuit, and ſo long Jour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neys, 'tis time to return to the place from whence we part<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, and to finiſh the clearing of the point of Profit, by a third Rule, which ſhall b' added to the two precedent; This ought, as hath been ſaid, t'accompany or follow the War; In the third place, I ſay then, When the War inflames with violence and fury, and that there's danger, leſt it conſume inavoidably the good of the State, and the ſubſtance of the People, The Prince ought, if it be poſſible for him, to quench it, and t'imitate thoſe wiſe Pilots, who uſe to ſtrike ſail, and to gain ſome ſafe Harbour, if the Tempeſt be too ſtrong. <hi>Lewis</hi> th'Eleventh oractiſed wiſely this Rule, as <hi>Philip</hi> of <hi>Comines</hi> hath obſerved it. The <hi>Venetians</hi> alſo have done the like in all times, as I could give you ſeveral Examples; and even the <hi>Spaniards,</hi> not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding the fierceneſs of their humour, and jealouſie for their Reputation, have not always declin'd it, as they have done of late, in their proſecutions of the Duke of <hi>Savoy,</hi> ſince the death of the late King, and when they believed themſelves to be ſole Arbiters of the Deſtiny of <hi>Italy;</hi> As Inexplorable as they were, when th'Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vens ſmiled upon them, and that Fortune was propitious to them; Nothing was ſeen more tractable or docile than they, when Fortune changed her favour, and expreſſed a greater deſire for Peace, than they had made our for War. And the paſſage of <hi>Sura,</hi> being forced for the Relief of <hi>Caſall,</hi> and the State of <hi>Milan</hi> in danger to be our Prey, if our Thoughts for Conqueſt had been as aptly diſpoſed, as th'Advantage and Juſtice: No perſons ever were more ſubmiſs to the King's Will in all things, or better diſpoſed t' Accept of all the conditions his Majeſty was pleaſed t'impoſe upon them.</p>
                  <p>The foundation of this Rule is, That the Felicity of Subjects, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the principal Law, and th'ultimate Meaſure of th' Actions and Conduct of a Prince; To decline it, is never permitted him, but to return with great advantage, and t'imitate the Sun, which draws not up the vapours and fatneſs of th'Earth, but to make it the more fruit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful, and of a livelier ſpirit, and of a more active virtue; Wherefore they, who by obſtinacy, or by ſome other particular paſſion, nouriſh a War that is fatal to their Subjects, wander very much from th'End of their Charges. And the memory of <hi>Francis</hi> the Firſt, and <hi>Charls</hi> the Fifth, is not recorded with Honour in Hiſtory, for that

The King truly Religious to a ſcruple in preſerving the Peace that was betwixt us and them, and in ſparing it in a time when we might have lawfully diſturbed it, hath been ill requited for that grace, and the ſame Men, to whom we gave life at <hi>Heidelbourge,</hi> were the Troops, as hath already been obſerved, which ſurprized <hi>Philisbourge</hi> from us, and made that great Wound, that will bleed it may be to th'End of the War.

                  <p>THe World is to be ſatisfied of a moſt Important Truth, which is neceſſary to be known, and the Matter more exactly handled, which hath been but lightly touched in the precedent Diſcourſe. It muſt be made t'appear; That 'tis not the King that hath broken the Rule, which hath been formerly eſtabliſhed, but his Enemies, who have forced from him the Means of obſerving it; They have alwaies oblig'd him t' have th' Armes in his hands, though he had a Deſire to quit them; and having pitty for th'Evils of his Subjects, and trouble for all the Wounds, which <hi>Christendome</hi> received, and for the great effuſion of blood in the War, made all the proffers he could make with Honour, t'obtain an honeſt and ſure Peace.</p>
                  <p>In effect, He hath hearkned with the moſt favourable Eates, and with a ſpirit the beſt prepared that could be deſired, t' all the good Offices, which his Holineſs laid out upon that Occaſion; He deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered Faithfully and in Warrantable form, the neceſſary paſſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ports for our Enemies Deputies; He named his Agents to go to th' Appointed places for that Holy-work; And omitted nothing of
<pb n="64" facs="tcp:33686:37"/>what might be expected from a Prince, really deſirous of Peace; And the demonſtrations he hath given, were not falſe Enſigns or de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceitfull Evidences, but certain marks and Concluſive Arguments of the deſire He had for it; I affirm nothing, but what the Pope and his Nuncioes do certifie; that Newtral Princes and their Miniſters of State have acknowledged, that the greateſt part of <hi>Chriſtendome</hi> knows, and whereof the Conſcience of our Enemies is Convinced. But they made onely falſe ſhews, and ſtudied Countenances of de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſires for Peace, and for the quiet of <hi>Chriſtendome,</hi> whilſt they Imploy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed their Wits to find out Inventions, to continue the War, and la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boured with all their powers to lengthen the Troubles, and to Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petuate th' Actions of the VVar. They ſent indeed Deputies to <hi>Collen,</hi> wither they might go with Safety and Honour, but 'twas for two Ends, both advantagious to them, but were not ſuch as the Chriſtian Common-vvealth aſpired unto, with ſo much heat, and whereof there was not ſo great need, as the Ceſſation of the VVar. The firſt, to deceive the VVorld by that fair Apparance, and to make ſimple perſons believe, that they had not onely a deſire for Peace, but that they made haſte to make it, and burned with Impatience to give a beginning to ſo neceſſary, and to ſo much deſired a VVork; And all this, to ſecure themſelves by theſe Illuſions and Dexterities, of the Blame would be given them for keeping of <hi>Chriſtendome</hi> ſo long in Trouble, and for powring out ſo much Oyl and Brimſtone on the fires that they have there kindled, and which have almoſt redu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced it t' Aſhes.</p>
                  <p>The ſecond End, was, to lay us aſleep by that ſhew, and to render us more Defective and Cold, by that their exteriour Deſire for peace, to put our ſelves into a Condition of ſuſteining the VVar, which they would make us; To dead alſo by the ſame Means them, who had a mind to joyn with us, and t'hinder them to be of that Party, where their Intereſt and Honour obliged them; And t' untye from our Amity and allyance them who were already entred, by propoſing to them Conditions, in ſhew of more advantage if they treated apart, than ſuch as they ſhould have in a Treaty of Generall Peace; And in perſecuting them, with that politique Maxim, That in the mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of Society and Leagues the ſtorm falls upon the Laſt that treat, who pay the Charges of the VVar, and that the firſt are the Perſons, who gather the Profit, and vvho Carry in the Crops of the field vvhich others have Husbanded and thereof ſovved the Seed. But our Deputies, and thoſe of our Confederates, for vvhom they ſent no Paſports, or ſuch, as vvere Lame or Defective in the form or the matter, vvould not render themſelves in the place appointed for the Treaty, becauſe they had denied them th' Entry, and ſhut up the paſſages by that Artifice; A proceeding certainly very Injurious to th'<hi>Holy Chair,</hi> vvhoſe Mediation they have long abuſed to diſſemble their Deceit, and Comical Demeanor to the reſt of the VVorld, vvhich the <hi>Spaniards</hi> have Acted by Apparances very diſtant, from
<pb n="65" facs="tcp:33686:37"/>their Intentions, and very contrary to the Truth, as we ſhall prove by two Infallible proofs.</p>
                  <p>Th'one is, Th'Anſwer made at <hi>Vienna,</hi> in the month of <hi>July,</hi> in the year 1637, to th' Ambaſſador of the Duke of <hi>Florence,</hi> upon th'in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance he then made t' have Authentique Paſports, as well for our Deputies, as for them of our Allies. They would not, as they ſaid, grant Paſports to the Crown of <hi>Swede,</hi> with whom they had a particular Treaty, nor for the Princes in Rebellion to them; whereof they that were in Arms, as the <hi>Landgrave</hi> of <hi>Heſſe,</hi> laboured to make their Accommodation apart; and th'others upon whom the ſtorm fell, and had been put into the Proſcription of th'Empire, were in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>capable to Treat, and had no difference to determine, but what was determined by th'Emperors Sword, and by the Laws of th' Empire; And in general, it was their ſenſe, That it did not belong to De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pendent and Subaltern Princes, in which number they comprehend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed all the Princes of th'Empire, to ſend Deputies to an Aſſembly, ſuch as was to be kept at <hi>Collen,</hi> where none ought t'Intervene, but the Deputies of Abſolute and Independent Princes; And that the King of <hi>Spain</hi> was juſtly to be condemned, if he had not promiſed the contrary, which they were well aſſured he had done; Not to meddle with th'Affairs of <hi>Germany;</hi> And that he would take it ill if th'Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perour ſhould intermeddle in th'Affairs of his Kingdom, and favour the Revolted of his Subjects, and give heat to their Rebellions; That if he deſired Paſports to ſend to treat of the Quarrel had with the King of <hi>Spain,</hi> and of the difference had with the Duke of <hi>Lorrain,</hi> they were ready to grant them.</p>
                  <p>'Tis eaſie by the whole courſe of this Anſwer, and by the ſecret ſenſe it contains, that th'<hi>Hatred</hi> they bear us is immortal, and that th' Envy they conceive againſt us is th'ordinary Devil which torments them; That the particular Peaces they have ſought with ſo much Vehemency and Artifices, were not planks for them to paſs with more caſe t' an Univerſal Peace, but the means of making us th' hotter and more violent War, and to charge us in more places, and by a greater number of Engines; And to make ſome reflection upon the matter of this plauſible Anſwer, I will ſay, That being as the world believes them, ſuch great men of Policy, and ſo dextrous in th'Art of diſſimulation, whereof they have gained the Reputation, They too openly vented their deſign to change th'Empire into Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narchy, and to leave no mark of Soveraignty, or any impreſſion of a Free Power in <hi>Germany;</hi> Or to declare the Truth, and make it out as it was; 'Tis not, though they then had their ſpirits full, and heated with the deſign, That they wanted power to retain it, if they had been willing t' have concealed it, and t' have denied it the Light, but ſince th'unhappy and fatal Peace of <hi>Prague,</hi> they believed t'have ſo well and effectively adjuſted their Arrows, and weather'd them, that nothing could hinder them of ſucceſs, and that th' Anſwer was made in the ſtrength of their Hopes, and in th'Higheſt Elevation of their Thoughts.</p>
                  <pb n="66" facs="tcp:33686:38"/>
                  <p> For what other Thing could it ſignifie, in Comparing the Princes of th'Empire with the Subjects of the King of <hi>Spain,</hi> and to put them in a parallel and equal degree of condition, Than to begin to degrade them of their Soveraignty, which no perſon to this day hath conteſted with them? Than to make the Tranſmutation ſpoken of, and reduce many States, who have particular Lords, under a ſingle Monarque? And yet no perſon is ignorant of the Dignity of th'Empire of the Weſt, as of the Powers that conſtitute it; And that they reſide not in the ſole Perſon of th' Emperor, As the Power and dignity of Monarchies have their ſeat in the Perſons of the Princes that poſſeſs them, But in th'Aſſembly and Conjunction of th'Electors, and of th'other Princes of <hi>Germany,</hi> who together, make the Body, whereof th'Emperor is the moſt conſiderable Member, and Superiour in Excellency to th'other Members, conſidered apart, and ſever'd from the Body they form; There's no perſon alſo but knows, That the Majeſty of th'Emperor, and that Auguſt Character which doth diſtinguiſh him from Monarques, are not derived from the power he hath over a great extent of Country ſubmitted unto him, and over a great number of Subjects, which he governs, but ariſe from the Greatneſs to which he is raiſed, and from the Rank that he enjoys above many Soveraigns that encompaſs him, who do him honour, and are bound in certain occaſions, as receiving th'In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veſtiture of their Eſtates from th'Emperor, to ſerve him with their Lands and Perſons, and owe him (with exception t'other Soveraigns not of the Body of th'Empire) a particular Honour and an extraor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary Veneration.</p>
                  <p>But leſt th' Emperor, following th'humour of Great Perſons, ſhould give too great an Extent t' his Authority, and make Inva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions upon the Rights and Liberties of the Princes of th'Empire; And leſt, the Princes puffed with the ſpirit of Soveraignty, which they bring with them into the world, and drunk with the ſweetneſs of the Command they exerciſe over their Subjects, ſhould become Indocile towards th' Emperor, and undertake to draw to them all th'Authority of th'Empire, Conſtitutions have been made, and Laws eſtabliſhed, which bound their Juriſdiction, and qualifie their diſtinct Powers, and hold the Ballance at its juſt point amongſt them, and make the neceſſary Counterpoiſe, Leſt that th' one be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coming too ſtrong, ſhould force and deſtroy th'other; And 'tis that temper which th'Emperour and the Princes of th' Empire have aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaulted, by ſeveral ſtratagems on divers occaſſions, and the Limits, which they would have often defaced; 'Tis that Counterpoiſe which they have endeavoured to unſettle, and to ruine that Harmony, in whoſe conſervation th' Happineſs of <hi>Germany</hi> principally conſiſts, the ſafety of <hi>Christendom,</hi> and the moſt aſſured means of reſiſting th'<hi>Ottoman</hi> Forces, when they over-run on the Land ſide; And 'tis that, th'Houſe of <hi>Austria,</hi> doth enforce more of late, than ever to perform, what they labour with Sails and Oars; 'Tis the great
<pb n="67" facs="tcp:33686:38"/>work of their Aim and Ambition, and could they maſter it, as ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny times ſince the Battel of <hi>Prague</hi> they have been very near it, it would not b' Impoſſible for them to convert Kingdoms into Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinces, and to make up in time the Monarchy, whereof they have ſo many years paſt laid the Deſign.</p>
                  <p>And therefore th' Affairs of th'Empire being in this condition, I leave it to the Judgment of every Impartial Perſon, whether the King had not a great Intereſt in th'Affairs of <hi>Germany;</hi> and great reaſon t'engage; And whether h'ought t'have promiſed to th'Houſe of <hi>Austria</hi> the liberty of finiſhing at his pleaſure, and without re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſtance, that pernicious deſign of Univerſal Monarchie? Whether h'ought with Newtral Eyes and folded Arms have permitted th'In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>heritance of his Neighbours to be burnt, whoſe flames might eaſily reach his Countries? To Judgment I ſubmit it, whether th' Aiding of Princes oppreſſed and ſtript, be to protect Rebellious Subjects? And whether diſtinction ought not to be made betwixt them, in whoſe hands God hath put the ſword to defend their Rights againſt Strangers, as well as to puniſh th' Enemies of their Country, and them, who have no other Right to bear Arms, than what they re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive from th' hands of their Prince? The King then could not aban<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don the cauſe of miſerable <hi>Germany,</hi> nor permit the Liberty of its Princes to be raviſh'd, without being an Enemy to his People, and Deſertor of the Chriſtian Republique; And he was no leſs obliged to maintain, by his Endeavours and Arms, the Conſtitution of th'Empire, againſt th'Houſe of <hi>Auſtria,</hi> which laboured to deſtroy it, than He was at that time, when He uſed his Authority, and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted his Forces to march out of his Kingdom t'oppoſe the Count <hi>Palatin</hi>'s deſign of Alteration; And that the reſolutions taken in th'Aſſembly at <hi>Worms</hi> ſhould not be executed. But this matter ſhall be further cleared in the Treary of the Monarchy of th' Houſe of <hi>Austria.</hi>

                  <p>As to the Princes of <hi>Germany,</hi> who did not co-operate with th'holy Intentions of the King, and departed from his Alliance and that of <hi>Swede;</hi> who thought to ſecure their Eſtates and Fortune by a parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular Treaty, and to find in the Peace of <hi>Prague</hi> an Inviolable San<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctuary againſt the Evil they did apprehend; Theſe Princes, I ſay, are very blind, or of ſmall courage, if they do not ſee the ſervitude is pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pared for them; if they dare not refuſe to put their hands to the making of that Chain which is t'hold them; if they have been taken with the Charms th'Houſe of <hi>Auſtria</hi> had preſented unto them, and have followed th' ill inſpirations have been given them by pretended friend; if the Peace they thought to make, hath not been ſo much a Peace as a change of War, and paſſage to new Troubles, and to more dangerous Emotions than thoſe they had quitted; if in their preſent condition they march betwixt Precipices, and ought to be the Prey of the Victor, on what Side ſoever the Victory falls, and bear the puniſhment of their defection from the good Party, or be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come
<pb n="68" facs="tcp:33686:39"/>their laſt Conqueſt, and make the Concluſion of the Deſign, they had in Judgment; In this Dereliction, wherein their impru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence, and the Corruption of ſome other cauſes had caſt them; 'Tis yet better for them, to return to the good Party, and find ſafety and honour by aiding in order to the Victory, than to perſevere in a Society, where they muſt periſh whatſoever happens; I know well, that 'tis not eaſie to get out of a Precipice, nor out of a Laby<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rinth, when a man is far advanced into it; But, notwithſtanding th' Artifices of th'Houſe of <hi>Auſtria,</hi> and the Toils they ſet in all places to ſtop the Princes eſcape from them; Th' offences they have com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted againſt them, who came ſo generouſly to relieve them, and th'high ingratitude wherewith they have paid the precious Blood was ſpilt, and the life of one of the moſt Illuſtrated Perſons of the world loſt for their ſafety; If there remains, I ſay, in their Souls any dram of Love for the Liberty of their Nation, which hath been in great veneration vvith them, and that they be ready to receive good fortune, vvhen ſhe offers herſelf unto them, The favourable Revolution that begins to ſhine upon <hi>Germany,</hi> vvill give them means to break the Bonds that hold them; <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  <p>As to the particular Treaty which th'<hi>Austrians</hi> then conceived to make with the <hi>Swedes,</hi> and purſued to make with much vehemency, which hath been very often out in ſunder, and as often tied up again; which was the deſign of the laſt Reſolutions of the penultime <hi>Dyet of Ratiſbone,</hi> and the foundation of th'hopes of the good Succeſs of th'Enemies Affairs, The time hath made it appear, that it was no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing but a countermine of the <hi>Swedes,</hi> t'amuze th'Imperialiſts; As it was the deſign of th'Imperialiſts, in caſe the Treaty became abor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive, to lull aſleep the <hi>Swedes,</hi> and to render them flower and leſs inflamed to make War; or it was a ſtudied ſtroak of Addreſſe, and a ſubtil Artifice to cheat their Confederates, with ſome ſhew of Apprenhenſion and Jealouſie, and to provoke them t'intend with more vigour, and with ſtronger ſubventions, th' Affairs of the League; For that wiſe and adviſed Nation was not ſo great an Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my to their Good, nor ſo ill-ſighted in the Truth of their Intereſts, as to be deprived willingly, in favour of the King of <hi>Poland,</hi> of a great and rich Province, eaſie for them to be conſerved, and to be at greater Liberty to defend his Conqueſts in <hi>Germany,</hi> and to make progreſs upon the Uſurpators and Deſertors of the Liberty of that Country; And afterwards to renounce, what he enjoyed, as moſt ſtable and Immovable, for a ſum of Money offered him, and for ſo caſual a Benefit, as Mony, that may eaſily be ſpent or waſted. That if the Houſe of <hi>Auſtria</hi> conſented, that the Crown of <hi>Swede</hi> ſhould keep the Provinces and Places, which it could not take from them;
<pb n="69" facs="tcp:33686:39"/>The Deſigns of that Ambitious Houſe, and the Policy of its Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters of State, were too well known to be perſwaded, That it was for no longer Time than was neceſſary t'Accompliſh in other places their Deſigns, or to procure unto themſelves either the greater Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctory, or the more advantagious Peace; That no Chriſtian Power could or would oppoſe the War to be made them, whom it calls Agreſſors of th'Empire, and the diſturbers of the peace of <hi>Germany.</hi> In another place, Diſcourſe ſhall be made of the Certainty may be raiſed on the promiſes of that Houſe, when it may break t'ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage.</p>
                  <p>Th'other Proof to be made uſe of is freſh, and Memory need not be ſtrained to remember it, 'Tis preſent to th'underſtanding, and to the ſenſe of them; who know any thing of our Affairs; 'Tis that which paſſed this year at <hi>Hambrough</hi> touching th'Adjuſtment of ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary Conditions, for proceeding in the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

It firſt hapned, that <hi>Sir Sutzan,</hi> Deputy to the King of <hi>Hungary,</hi> retired, when th'other Deputies were upon the point of Reſolving ſome thing for that pretended Adjuſtment, without giving notice of it; in Imitation of the Count of <hi>Curts,</hi> who practiſed the ſame a little before, And re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turned ſix weeks after with imperfect Authorities, and with defe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctive Letters of Credence, that it might not fail on the King of <hi>Spain</hi>'s part; The Negotiation was ſtopped: What th' Imperialiſts did, was to thruſt Time by the ſhoulder, and to ſee whether that great Clowd gathered near <hi>France,</hi> would not produce ſomething to their advantage, and bring upon that Kingdom the Tempeſt, which they had promiſed to themſelves, and whereof they had furniſhed a great part of the Matter.</p>
                  <p>Moreover, not t'appear Averſe to Peace, nor to be Charged with th'Hatred that would be charged on them by the Voluntary Continuation of the War, They permitted, that the broken Treaty ſhould be ſet on foot, and ſent to <hi>Hambrough</hi> the Count of <hi>Averſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bery</hi> with a more Ample power, by virtue whereof, after long Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>putes, and long Conteſts of ſpirit and words, Th' Adjuſtment de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſired, was reſolved, and Conditions ſigned, to which nothing was wanting for Execution, but the Ratification of Intereſſed Princes in that Affair. But that failed on the part of the King of <hi>Hungary,</hi> who inſtead of ſending a pure and ſimple Ratification, as was neceſſary,
<pb n="70" facs="tcp:33686:40"/>and as his Deputy was obliged to procure, and as the Kings was made, ſent it lame, and Limited with ſo many Modifications and Reſerves, that it was eaſie to ſee; That it was but Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>medy, and the continuation of the Game, which the <hi>Sir Sutzan</hi> had plaid, t'Amuze the world, and to give <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  <p>I add to what I have before ſaid, To diſcover the true paſſion the King had to remove all the Rubs that might ſtop the way to Peace, and t'omit nothing that might haſten that Holy Work; that he had given power to <hi>Sir</hi> of <hi>Avaux</hi> his Ambaſſador, t' Accord, in the Paſports, he ſhould deliver to the King of <hi>Hungary</hi>'s Commiſſio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners, a Title, which to that time h' had vainly deſired of us, and had always conſtantly been refuſed him, for the Conſiderations, which ſhall be laid down in the Treaty of the Monarchy; And to ſhew alſo th'Indubitable Averſion the King of <hi>Hungary,</hi> with all his Houſe, had to the Peace, which all <hi>Chriſtendom</hi> demands, and is ſo neceſſary for it; At the ſame time that he refuſed it, by his Eva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions and Proffers, He bought dearly the Continuation of that Peace he had made with the <hi>Turk,</hi> and conſented, That almoſt two hundred Villages ſhould be cut off from his Frontiers, to lengthen the Territories of the <hi>Turk.</hi>

T'handle then this Matter, and to diſtribute it in Order, I ſay, That although a Prince ought to b' Induſtrious to fortifie himſelf with Alliances, and t'intereſs the greateſt number of Powers he can in his Conſervation; 'Tis ever an ill fortune for him, if the good weal of his Countries, and the Matter of his Fortune depends upon another Mans will; And if he have not in himſelf, and in his Power, the prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciple of his ſafety, and the Revenge of Diſgraces; If that fail him, and a powerful Enemy aſſault him, He is often oppreſſed before his Friends put themſelves into a poſture to defend Him; And th'Evil
<pb n="72" facs="tcp:33686:41"/>hath ſtruck its ſtroak, before his Allies are reſolved to go to fight bis Enemies.</p>
                  <p>The Reaſon of this is, That a wiſe Prince ought not, but with the Lateſt t'Embarque in a War, or expoſe himſelf with precipitation in a thing that hath nothing certain but th'Expence, that therein is to be made, and whoſe ſucceſs more than all other things in the world, depends upon th'incertainty of Fortune, and upon the mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of other Incident Cauſes. Wherefore he muſt ever labour to divert the ſtorm with Addreſs, before he undertakes to break it by Force; And endeavour timely the ways of Accommodation, and that the Means of his Interceſſion and Propoſals precede the Motion of his Arms; And when all this ſhall prove unprofitable, and that the gentle Remedies to but ſharpen th'Evils, and that he muſt re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolve to make uſe of Extremes; There is much way to be gone over, and difficulties to be overcome, before arrival there, many things are to be furniſhed and fitted before Entry <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  <p>And if he ſend but weak Supplies, and light Refreſhings to his Friends, what will it prove but an impertinent advance, and a loſt Expence; To caſt a few drops of water upon a great fire, which kindle it rather than put it out; Provoke the diſeaſe, rather than cure the ſick perſon? And if he reſolve t'Arm powerfully, and to raiſe great Forces in favour of his Allies, but will not do it without tak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of Sureties and Pawns for th'others faith; without agreeing upon Re-emburſment, and without many other Conditions, which oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſion a long Conteſt and Debate; The Prince who hath th'Enemy upon him, and the fire in his Country, ſhall periſh at leiſure, or make ſome conſiderable loſs: But th' Aſſailant makes his prepara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions before-hand, and in ſilence, the quickeſt and ſuddeneſt Invaſion poſſibly to ſurprize him, and t'oppreſs him, before he can know it, or can be Relieved; and will cauſe all ſorts of Inventions and En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gines to play to ſtop or ſubvert the Subventions which might come from his Allies.</p>
                  <p>I will produce, for the clearing and confirmation of what I have ſaid, two Illuſtrious Examples, and from two of the wiſeſt and moſt famous Nations of <hi>Europe,</hi> in th' Art of the Conduct of Negotia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, and governing of Enterprizes. It muſt b' endeavoured by th'aid of the Narratives, to make the face of the Diſcourſe cheerful, which too long a Reaſoning would render auſtere, and to divert the plunge him, if it were not interrupted. The firſt Example ſhall be taken from the League made betwixt <hi>Pius</hi> the 5<hi rend="sup">th</hi>, <hi>Philip</hi> the 2<hi rend="sup">d</hi>, and the <hi>Venetians,</hi> againſt <hi>Selim</hi> the 2<hi rend="sup">d</hi>, who had aſſaulted th'Iſland of <hi>Cyprus.</hi> This Evidence is to be given to the Piety of <hi>Philip,</hi> that he did not expect Solicitation for the Relief of the <hi>Venetians</hi> in this oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſion, and that he offered them, and ſent them his Maritine Forces a year before the concluſion of the League; But what was done in
<pb n="73" facs="tcp:33686:41"/>the purſute of it, brought not the fruit that was expected; The Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>medies came not time enough, and the Relief was prepared, with ſo great Tediouſneſſe, and Marched ſo ſlowly, That <hi>Nicoſia</hi> was loſt before the <hi>Spaniſh</hi> and <hi>Venetian</hi> Forces met, That was the Capital City of <hi>Cyprus,</hi> and one of the beſt Fortifications of th'Eaſt. As the <hi>Spaniards</hi> put not to Sea, but with the Belief to ſecure it, ſo they a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bated of their Edge, when they knew it was loſt; And though in the beginning, they'd made ſhew t' and the <hi>Venetians</hi> in Earneſt; It was not poſſible, after that loſſe, to make <hi>John Adre Doria</hi> their General t'advance for the Relief of <hi>Famagouſt,</hi> which then held out, and wherewith, if it had been Conſerved, there had been hopes to Recover what was loſt, and to retake <hi>Nicoſia.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Though this was ſo, yet it was not the ſole Rigour, which <hi>Doria</hi> Exerciſed towards the <hi>Venetians,</hi> nor the ſole Bitterneſſe they had to drink from his Cup, during the time of th'Expedition; whilſt th' Armies were at Sea, and that they were apparantly to march for mutual Conſervation, Hee Commanded his Ships apart from the <hi>Venetians,</hi> and marched ſeparately, To be free from Engagement in any Enterprize, or to ſecond th' heat of the Republique, which could not reſolve to retire without ſome undertaking. The ſmall Deſigns they propoſed unto him, he rejected, as unworthy of the For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>e Commanded and the Reputation of th'Army. In the great and difficult Matters, He would not Engage by Reaſon of the ſmall Time that reſted to finiſh them; And that they were upon the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clination of <hi>Autumn</hi> when the Tempeſts are frequent in the <hi>Levant</hi> Sea, and Navigation dangerous. So that two fair-Armies re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tired without doing more than making of a Noiſe, and one of the greateſt Preparations that hath been ſeen upon the Sea of a long <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>ime, Acted no memorable thing, but in producing nothing that was memorable.</p>
                  <p>It was ſaid, That it was not of Kindneſs but of Jealouſie, That <hi>Philip</hi> ſo freely offered his Forces to the <hi>Venetians,</hi> and was Encli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned to that Deſign for fear, leſt if they went alone to diſſipate that ſtorm, and to reſiſt the great Powers of <hi>Selim,</hi> Their Reputation might be raiſed to ſome Exceſs, and make them Conſiderable in <hi>Chriſtendome,</hi> and particularly in <hi>Italy,</hi> beyond what was expedient for the Good of his Affair. But he ſought a Temper of Aid, which was impoſſible for him to find, and as his Retentive Spirit and diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>truſtfull humour diſpoſed him naturally in all things t' allow the leaſt He Could to hazard, In this Action, He Endeavoured to gain without danger of loſs, and to Defend the <hi>Venetians</hi> in declaring on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly a deſire to Conſerve them, and t' hinder the progreſs of the <hi>Turk</hi> by the ſole Reputation of his Armes, and by the ſingle Demonſtration of his Forces.</p>
                  <p>But this Deſign miſcarrying, The League above ſpoken of, vvas Concluded the following year, though it vvas not without much Conteſt and Labour, The violent and paſſionate Endeavours of <hi>Pius</hi>
                     <pb n="74" facs="tcp:33686:42"/>the fifth for that buſineſs, vvere ſtronger than all the Difficulties the <hi>Spaniards</hi> framed, and all th' Inconveniences vvhich they Cauſed t' Ariſe. A little ſtay muſt be made here, to relate the proceedings which the <hi>Spaniards</hi> and the <hi>Venetians</hi> had there, and to repreſent the ſubtilties and ſtratagems, which they practiſed mutually in the war of Wit; It being the ſubject, which engaged me to product this Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample, and what hath been ſaid above, was only to ſerve it for paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſage and Avenue. They were then eight entire Months in Conteſting upon the Conditions of the Treaty, without finding an End of them; Much was agitated and little reſolved, and the flow and Dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficult humour of the <hi>Spaniards</hi> furniſhed alwaies Matter for the Lengthning of it, and ſometimes Pretexts for the Breaking of it. In the mean Time <hi>Famagouſto</hi> was loſt; Inſolence Encreaſed in the <hi>Turk</hi> with the Victory; And th'Irreſolutions the Chriſtians Labou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red of were a neceſſary Argument to him of their Fear and Weak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe.</p>
                  <p>And yet it was impoſſible to Joyn ſpirits, which had ſuch different Intereſts and ſuch Contrary ends, as the <hi>Venetians</hi> and the <hi>Spaniards;</hi> They that were firſt Expoſed to the <hi>Turks</hi> Armes, and upon whom the greateſt weight of the War was to fall, preſt the ſpeedy Quen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ching of the Fire; But the <hi>Spaniards</hi> more remote from the danger, had not ſo great a deſire t'expell it, and being out of diſtance to be ſuddenly toucht with th'Evill that preſt the <hi>Venetians,</hi> Endeavoured only to be delivered of another Evill, The <hi>Barbarian</hi> Piracies, which conſtantly vexed them, They would have had the War Carried in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to that Country for to repreſſe them, or at leaſt, be aſſured, that it ſhould be done hereafter; And that the <hi>Venetians</hi> and they ſhould Joyntly endeavour, and with all their powers, to force from the Pi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rates their ſtrong holds, and from the <hi>Turks,</hi> their Harbours for their Fleets; But for Accord in this propoſall an expedient could not be found, nor ſecurity offered that would be received; The diſpoſition of the <hi>Venetians</hi> was ſuſpected by them, and they were diffident of ſuch an intereſſed Policy as theirs; and believed it full of Artifices and Snares; And as they who have Inclinations for deceit, have al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wayes fear of being deceived, They feared that the <hi>Venetians</hi> being in th'Haven, would forget who Aided them thither, and being ſafe from the Tempeſt that threatned them from <hi>Conſtantinople,</hi> They would no longer think of the Warr at <hi>Argieres</hi> and <hi>Thunis,</hi> nor Continue for anothers Intereſt the ſame Expences, they had laid out upon their own Intereſt.</p>
                  <p>Th'End then they purſued, and the Mark they aimed at, was this; To form a League <hi>offenſive and defenſive the Pope and</hi> Ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>netians; <hi>That this League ſhould be perpetual, That it ſhould have For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces alwayes at Sea, and that the Confederates ſhould make uſe of them, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to th' Exigency of th' Occaſions and Neceſſity of their Affairs.</hi> Thereupon they made propoſalls, as Ridiculous as Magnificent, and formed upon that foundation Deſigns as much ſwollen as their Cou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rage,
<pb n="75" facs="tcp:33686:42"/>And as high as their Hopes; They deſired, after the taking of <hi>Conſtantinople,</hi> and Ruining of the <hi>Turk,</hi> That they ſhould be bound to make War to the King of <hi>Perſia;</hi> To deſtroy <hi>Byſerte, Thunis,</hi> and <hi>Argieres;</hi> T' Exterminate the <hi>Seriphes</hi> from <hi>Africa,</hi> and to purſue in all places <hi>Mahomets</hi> Sect with Sword and Fire, and to pay him with uſe, what He had ſo largely borrowed of <hi>Chriſtendome;</hi> They did af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter theſe Propoſalls made, raiſe the powers of their Maſter above all that was great or formidable upon Earth, and Amplifie his Zeal to Religion, Exalt his proſperities and give Wings to his hopes.</p>
                  <p>It was eaſie to be ſeen, That all their Proceedings were nothing but Illuſion and Artifice; And that they laboured only to preſerve th'Apparances of good Chriſtians, and gain Reputation amongſt Credulous Souls and Weak ſpirits, who are ever in greater Number than the Wiſe; But when it was neceſſary to Come to the Particular Affair, and to the Subject for which they were met, The Relief of <hi>Cyprus;</hi> There was nothing ſo Cold, as they; nothing leſs Treatable; and after a long Debate and much Circumlocution about th' Affair, They returned alwaies to their diverſion; That they much deſired a League, and that all <hi>Chriſtendome</hi> would Unite in a Common Quar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rel; That Forces ſhould be Conſtantly on foot to Counterpoiſe and Check the <hi>Turkiſh</hi> Forces; But after all this Diſcourſe, they deſired that their firſt Propoſalls might prevail, and for the preſent nothing Undertaken or Aſſaulted but on the Coaſts of <hi>Barbary.</hi>

                  <p>This League, as they had formed it, ſecured all their Eſtates, and no Deſign was ever better Contrived for them, nor more to their ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage; for without Hazard of any thing, they put themſelves into a Condition to gain much; They reaped without ſowing, and contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry to th'ordinary diſpoſition of the things of this World, their ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantages Came purely to them, and without any Precedent or Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequent Evill. The Levies permitted them to be made upon the Lands of th'Eccleſiaſtiques, and the <hi>Croyſades</hi> the Pope granted them in th'Old and New world, gave them means to prepare a Fleet, and t'Entertain the Ships they were obliged to furniſh by the Conven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of the League; They made no new Enemy nor new War, They Continued only what they ever had with the <hi>Turk;</hi> And car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rying it into his Countrey they held it by Conſequence at diſtance with theirs, as they had done their Coaſts; And without being Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrained to Fortifie with Garriſons and Ships, They became free from th' Invaſions of the Pyrates, whoſe Aid the <hi>Turk</hi> made uſe of at Sea, and of ſuch petty Invaſions, as ruined particular perſons, and much Incommodated Trade, and they gained a great Reputation by that means in all places; And with the great Forces they had in Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dineſs to paſs from <hi>Italy</hi> into the Low <hi>Countreys,</hi> They kept all their Enemies in Check, and rendred themſelves formidable from <hi>Levant</hi> to the <hi>Ponant</hi> with the ſame Forces.</p>
                  <p>The Condition of the <hi>Venetians</hi> was very different from theirs, and the preſent State of their Affairs had another Colour and Face;
<pb n="76" facs="tcp:33686:43"/>They had an Enemy in hand, whoſe Friendſhip they were careful to cheriſh, and with whom they could not b' at difference without great loſſes, and without running of great danger; They were ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed, as it hath been already ſaid, to the firſt Impreſſions of his Arms, and to the firſt ſtrokes of the Tempeſt; ſome parts of their States by Sea, were at diſtance with th'others, and they could not relieve them but at great charges, and powerful Fleets; <hi>Candy</hi> alone was not leſs worthy of th'Ambition and Fortune of <hi>Selim,</hi> than the Kingdom of <hi>Cyprus,</hi> and that Iſland, which bridles the <hi>Archipelagus,</hi> and is the Paſſage, by which the Pirats of the <hi>Ponant</hi> ought of ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſity t'enter, gives him as great cauſe of Jealouſie as th'other, and no leſs deſire of being their Maſter; And the nearneſs of the <hi>Turk</hi> to <hi>Dalmatia, Eſclavonia,</hi> and <hi>Frioul,</hi> obliged them t'Arm no that ſide, and t'open all the veins of their Treaſures to furniſh ſo great an Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pence. Notwithſtanding all theſe Conſiderations, and all theſe diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culties, The League was concluded, The greater Intereſt over-ſwai'd the leſſer, and the general Afrights, which threatned <hi>Chriſtendom,</hi> recollected particular Affections, which had been eſtranged under a common deſign of Oppoſition, and to ſtop the Courſe, and repreſs the Violence of their Enemies. Since it hath been ſeen in the things which have preceded the Negotiation of the League now repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſented, what a dangerous Rock, and fatal Obſtacle it is, to a Prince in trouble, to depend upon another to get out: It may not be unne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary t'obſerve alſo the ſame Inconveniencies, and the ſame Stone of offence, in the things which have followed the Councluſion of that League.</p>
                  <p>When the League then was ſigned, and that each Confederate in the ſigning of it, had made his Reſervation, as 'tis the cuſtom, of ſome ſecret Intention, and ſome particular End, which he would not manifeſt; The time, which had been vainly ſpent in Delibera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, was redeemed in executing their Reſolutions. The Confede<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate Forces were put to Sea with diligence, and the <hi>Turk,</hi> whom proſperity made inſolent, and boaſted, that he wiſhed nothing more to <hi>Chriſtians,</hi> than the courage t'attend him, heard that our Army ſought him; In the mean time, his Army moved, and <hi>Selim</hi> know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing that ours drew towards his, would meet it half way, and take a part of th'advance, for to ſee ours, and to fight it. (But though both Armies burnt with the ſame heat, and deſired equally th'Encounter, 'tis a remarkable thing, that both of them were equally aſtoniſh'd at the firſt ſight; ſo true it is, that Mansſpirit ſtays not long in the ſame ſtation; That the Sight of an Object hath another effect than the Thought of it; And that th'Apprehenſion of a danger, operates di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſly, according to the nearneſs or remoteneſs of it; The two Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerals onely, <hi>Don John</hi> of <hi>Auſtria</hi> for the <hi>Chriſtians,</hi> and the <hi>Bacha Aly</hi> for the <hi>Turks,</hi> felt not the weight and chilneſs, which had ſeized th'Armies; And they reſolved to fight, againſt the Judgment almoſt of all the Chiefs that did accompany them. <hi>Don John</hi> of <hi>Auſtria</hi> was
<pb n="77" facs="tcp:33686:43"/>violently ſollicited by the Counſellors of <hi>Spain</hi> that were with him, not t' indanger the ſafety of all <hi>Chriſtendome,</hi> and the fourtune of his Maſter; They repreſented unto him, That although th'Hazard of the Battel was equal, the Conſequences of the Victory were not the ſame; And that of Forces gathered together, as the <hi>Chriſtians</hi> were, the like uſe could not be made, as of them which depended upon a ſingle Prince, and were animated with the ſame Spirit, and carried on with the ſame Intereſt, as thoſe of the <hi>Turk:</hi> But he, whoſe Soul was full of the Repreſentation of the Glory this great Action pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſed unto him, and of th'nopes of the Victory h'ought to gain, made them this Generous Anſwer, <hi>That it was time to fight, and not to deliberate, and that he had no need of Reaſonings or of Counſel for that End, but of Courage and Execution.</hi> Th' Event deceived not his Expectation; Fortune declared for the <hi>Christians,</hi> and the Victory they gained, opened the vvay for them to fairer Suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſes, if the <hi>Spaniards</hi> had not Betrayed them: But they had done enough, and according to their Intention, vvhich vvas, to prevent the <hi>Turk</hi> from making any nevv Progreſs upon the <hi>Christians,</hi> or that the <hi>Venetians</hi> ſhould at their Charges repair themſelves of their Spoils, and be revenged of their Loſſes. <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  <p>Moreover, though the Republick of <hi>Venice</hi> bears in it ſelf much greatneſs, and from all times, hath joyned to the Truth of a conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable Power, the Reputation of an extraordinary Wiſdom; Never<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theleſs, 'tis true, That oppoſing it to the Great <hi>Signior,</hi> and making a Parallel with that proud Dominator of <hi>Aſia,</hi> of <hi>Afrique,</hi> and of a part of <hi>Europe,</hi> It ſtands obſcured, and therein, 'Tis to compare the Courſe of a little Stream to the Rapidity of a great River.</p>
                  <p>A word more, ſince It will not be impertinent, and that the Thread of our Diſcourſe leads us to it; Of the Deſtiny of Princes, who are little in themſelves, or who have but a moderate ſtrength; 'Tis a pitiful thing to ſee to what Neceſſity the Petty Princes are reduced to maintain themſelves, and to how many Real Evils they are ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed to conſerve that vain Image of Liberty, and that ſweet Illuſion of Soverain Authority that doth bewitch them. In Expences, they conſume themſelves for their defence, and almoſt give All that might be taken from them, that Nothing might be taken from them; They are obliged t'obſerve all the Fancies and Motions of their Enemies and Friends; And if they ſubſiſt, 'tis not by their Strength, becauſe they have none, but by their Weakneſs, and becauſe their Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tries are of ſo little Concernment, that they beget not a Deſire in Ambitious perſons, nor that Juſtice ſhould be violated in the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queſt of them; or they are under ſhelter from th' Enterpriſes of th'one, by the Jealouſie of th'other, and preſerve their Liberty, for that th'Ambitious hinder one another to ceize upon them, and to become the Maſters.</p>
                  <p>The Petty Republick of <hi>Ragouſa</hi> maintains it ſelf, by the Tribute it pays to the <hi>Grand signior,</hi> and by the Preſents it makes to the Great Perſons of th'Houſe of <hi>Porta,</hi> and th'Inſolence of the Petty <hi>Sangiacs,</hi> their Neighbours, is reſtrained by Mony; And it doth Homage to the King of <hi>Spain</hi> to be free from diſturbance; And permits, what may pleaſe the <hi>Venetians,</hi> who could be content to find ſome juſt occaſion to poſſeſs themſelves of it, if they durſt, being a State very convenient for them, and ſeared in the midſt of the <hi>Gulf,</hi> whereof they call themſelves Lords; And it would make their Poſſeſſion and Enjoyment the more complete and firm. There's no queſtion, but the Duke of <hi>Florence</hi> would take from the Repub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lique of <hi>Luca,</hi> the Liberty and Peace it enjoys, if <hi>Spain</hi> did not Sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port and Relieve it with its protection, which is not given but ſold, as t'all th'others that depend upon it. It would be a great trouble to
<pb n="79" facs="tcp:33686:44"/>th'Houſe of <hi>Auſtria,</hi> if that State ſhould fall to the Mercy of a Power, that might prove too great by this Addition, after it had been made conſiderable; And would recall, if it might, the Boun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, as it boaſts, laid out upon it, or retain the Recompences, as th'other ſays, that have Rewarded their Service; What had become of <hi>Geneva,</hi> without th'Alliance of the <hi>Suiſſes,</hi> and without the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tection of <hi>France?</hi> Who knows not how often the Dukes of <hi>Savoy</hi> have reſolved t'aſſault it with open Forces, upon th'hopes of pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſed <hi>Spaniſh</hi> Relief, when they were Amity with it, and with th'<hi>Holy Chair?</hi> which had not failed, if they'd been engaged in an Enterpriſe, whoſe Appearence had been holy, and Pretence pious; And how often alſo (Fortune and th'Incounter of things having diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compoſed their Deſignes, and ſent into ſmoak th'hopes of thoſe Princes) have they formed Conſpiracies, and prepared ſecret Parties to ſurprize and carry that place? That if they now believe them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves free from that fear during the Minority of the Duke of <hi>Savoy,</hi> under its particular dependency upon <hi>France;</hi> and if the <hi>Suiſſes</hi> alſo ſeem to them a ſtronger Rampart, than they were, by reaſon of the preſent Conjunction, which renders them more Conſiderable to them, from whom they had cauſe to fear; ſo 'tis, that this perpetual Viciſſitude, which alters human Things, and that Inceſſant Motion, wherewith the Wheel of Fortune doth turn them, may produce ſuch a Conjuncture, when the <hi>French</hi> ſhall not have the Power, or the Will to protect them; And it would not be impoſſible, If the Revolution, which hath threatned <hi>Germany</hi> for many years, were Ended, But that it might extend to the <hi>Suiſſes</hi> Country, which is the Frontier, and that the Catholick Cantons might invade the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſtants, as they have often projected; And make by conſequence the Rampart which defends <hi>Geneva,</hi> to fall on the Catholiques ſide. How much ſafer, and with greater advantage, might ſome of theſe petty Princes, be made the Government rather than under the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tection of a great Prince? And might they not be happier to belong to a powerful Maſter, who would watch for their ſafety, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liver them from the Fears and Expences they are at to conſerve themſelves? Their Privileges alſo would be as Entire as they are, and their Liberty greater; ſince at leaſt, they ſhould be Healed of the Paſſion, whereof hath been lately ſpoken, and of th'Importunate Purſutes made to them by thoſe that Receive Penſions to Relieve them. The Princes to whom they ſhall give themſelves, will be more concerned in their own Intereſt, than in that ſhall depend onely upon their Crown; And the Breach made in their Country, if it ſhould be loſt, would be much greater by th'Intereſt Reputation, than if they loſt it themſelves, being upon their Faith, and charged ſolely with their defence; And the more they are at the devotion of their Friends, the more they will be indulged and in favour of their Inhabitants, leſt, they ſhould be perſwaded to ſome change, and that th'eaſineſs of ſhaking off the Yoak they have voluntarily put on,
<pb n="80" facs="tcp:33686:45"/>and to return to themſelves, oblige them t'undertake it.</p>
                  <p>But Mans condition is ſubject to ſo much Weakneſs, and our Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon is aſſaulted with ſo many Errors, that not onely Particular per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons, but whole Companies are often deceived in th'Election of the Good that is moſt proper for them, and are taken with the Pomp and Apparences, rather than with the Solidity and Truth of things; Or elſe truly, the Cuſtome they 've practiſed, and the Courſe exerciſed in ſome kind of Life, and in ſome form of Policy, is ſo ſtrong a Band, and ſo powerful a Charm for them, who are taken with it, That 'tis very hard for them t' have ſo much as a thought to break and deſtroy; Or elſe th' Abſolute Power and Soveraign Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority, are things ſo dear to them, who 'njoy them, That there's no Recompence for which they would quit them, and they had ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther onely poſſeſs the ſhadow with Notorious Incommodities, than to live in th'eaſieſt Dependency, and in the moſt commodious Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jection in the world; or at laſt, as there's nothing in this world; that hath not two faces, or Good, without Inconveniencies; ſo, though theſe Petty Princes are very ſenſible of the perjudice they ſuffer, to conſerve the fancy of Soveraignty they Adore, the Matters of Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jection, be they never ſo pleaſant, appear unto them more inſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portable; And they would b' afraid, to worſt their Condition in the Changing of it, and to quit a known and Certain Good, for a Doubtful and unknown Good; And exchange Evils, which the Newneſs would make Sharper and Heavier, for Evils, whoſe Cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtom had dulled the point, and allai'd the bitterneſs: What I have ſaid, is not to prepoſſeſs the thoughts of any perſon, nor to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwade, what a man hath not a will to believe, but onely to ſhew one of the faces of the Medal; That by ſuch a Repreſentation, they may the better judge of th'other; or elſe truly they may take it for a game of Wit, and for an exerciſe of Reaſonings, which is void of Deſign and Conſequence.</p>
                  <p>As to Princes, who have but a Moderate Power, as the Duke of <hi>Savoy</hi> for Example, There's no queſtion but the Nearneſs of two great Crowns, betwixt which he is ſhut, is his Security; And the Jealouſie th'one hath, leſt th'other ſeize upon the Dukes Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tries, and take away that Medium and Barrier, which makes betwixt their Territories the ſeparation, ſollicites them effectively t'hinder the Conqueſt of it with all their Forces. There's no doubt, I ſay, but the <hi>French</hi> had rather have that Duke for their Neighbour, than the King of <hi>Spain,</hi> and that the <hi>Spaniards</hi> would not bear any thing with more impatience, than to ſee the Domination of the <hi>French</hi> extend to the Dutchy of <hi>Milan,</hi> which is the Baſis that bears the reſt of their Countries in <hi>Italy.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>In the ſecond place, it ſeems a happy Fate for th'Houſe of <hi>Savoy,</hi> to produce ſuch excellent Princes for Peace and War; And that Heaven had granted them High Qualities to ſupply, what it hath denied them of Power; That with Wit and Courage they might
<pb n="81" facs="tcp:33686:45"/>make the Counterpoiſe to the Greatneſs and Powers of other Princes. Add, that th' Alliances of Blood, which they<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

And not to ſpeak of <hi>Savoy,</hi> which may be taken without much Reſiſtance, and where there is but one Fort which may be made uſeleſs by a Block<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>houſe that may almoſt defend it ſelf; Who knows not in how little time, <hi>Charls,</hi> led by the perſwaſion of his wife, being a <hi>Portugueſe,</hi> and chained to the fortune of <hi>Charls</hi> the Fifth, was ſtripped of the beſt part of <hi>Piedmont</hi> by <hi>Francis</hi> the Firſt, who had left his Poſterity in their ſhirts, if the Virtue of <hi>Philibert</hi> his ſon, who defeated us at St. <hi>Quintins,</hi> and th'ill Fortune of <hi>France,</hi> had not opened by a Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of Peace, the Gate to many places formerly ſhut unto him, for many years of War?

                  <p>Take the beginning and progreſs of this Affair.

This Calm laſted during the Time of th' Emperour <hi>Rodolphus</hi> and <hi>Mathias,</hi> and of th' Archdukes <hi>Ferdinand</hi> and <hi>Leopold,</hi> and untill ſome of th' <hi>Uſcoques</hi> did interrupt it, and the Gulf was ſo much vexed with their Violence and Robberies, That they extended them to the Republiques Havens, and in one of them Robbed a Galley, and having killed all the perſons in it, by a Barba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rian Inhumanity of the New World, did Eat th'Heart of the Cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain that Commanded it.</p>
                  <p>Theſe <hi>Uſcoques</hi> are a ſort of People gathered of many Nations; <hi>Croates, Hungarians, Eſclavonians,</hi> and baniſht perſons from the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>publique, who have neither Lands nor Induſtry, but Live and Main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain themſelves by Rapines and Murders, And whom th'Enormity of Crimes, and the Fear of Puniſhments, or the Luſts of an Irregular Life, Exempt from the Bridle of Laws and Magiſtrates, have caſt upon a violent Aſſociation, and into a bloody Commerce; They dwell in <hi>Eſclavonia,</hi> otherwiſe called <hi>Venade,</hi> and anciently <hi>Liburnia,</hi> under the Mountain <hi>Morlache,</hi> which makes a part of that, which is called the Chain of the World; their principal Habitation and Den of Theeves, are the Towns of <hi>Segna</hi> and the Fortreſs of <hi>Seriſa,</hi> which was taken from them by <hi>James Zane,</hi> Governour of <hi>Dalmatia.</hi> They're Subjects to th' Emperour and to th' Archduke of <hi>Grets,</hi> who may boaſt of Men at their Command, born only to d' Evill, and to be the Flayl of other Men; As God hath under the Generality of his Creatures, and in th'extent of his Empire, Devils, as good Angels, Thundrings and Lightnings, as well as delectable and wholeſome Meteors. Theſe perſon then made Incurſions upon th' <hi>Adriatique</hi> Sea, and though the pretence of their Robberies, was to make War to the <hi>Turk,</hi> and as good Subjects, they Armed themſelves with that fair Colour, which is ſo familiar with their Maſters; yet they did not forbear to Rob and put <hi>Chriſtians</hi> to Ranſome, and above all Men, the <hi>Venetians,</hi> as the <hi>Turks.</hi> And the Banner of St. <hi>Mark,</hi> was not more Inviolable to them, than th'half Moon of <hi>Conſtantinople.</hi> Their Inroads and Invaſions ſtopped not at Sea; They Landed often, and paſſing by the Lands of the Republique forced into the <hi>Grand Signiours</hi> Countries, from whence they took all they could carry away, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turned Loaden with ſpoyls, whereof the Richeſt and moſt Precious were the Booty of the Officers of th'Empire, and of th' Archdukes; Beſides the Duties belonging to th'Admiralty, which they paid, as 'tis the Cuſtome of Protected Pyrates, better than any people of the World.</p>
                  <p>There was no need of this occaſion, to put the <hi>Turk</hi> into an ill humour againſt the <hi>Venetians,</hi> and t' Heat the Blood of thoſe Ava<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritious Souls, who do not uſe to ſuffer Loſſes from their Chriſtian Neighbours, but are in perpetual Avarice to draw Tributes, or to take ſomewhat from them; Quick expreſſion were made of it to the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>publique, and their Reſentments were accompanied with ſharp Complaints and Threatnings of Revenge, if they did not ſpeedily re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>medy
<pb n="84" facs="tcp:33686:47"/>the diſorder, and cauſe that evill to ceaſe which increaſed day<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, and ſtrengthned by their Connivence.</p>
                  <p>This was the Read Deſign of the Princes of th' Houſe of <hi>Auſtria,</hi> and chiefly of the <hi>Spaniards,</hi> who endeavoured to raiſe an ill under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding betwixt the <hi>Vanetian</hi> and the <hi>Grand Signior,</hi> and to put them into diſorder; That the Neceſſity of their Relief, if the <hi>Turk</hi> broke with the Republique, might take away their deſire of Croſſing them in the Plot they had laid t'oppreſs the Duke of <hi>Savoy.</hi> But the Republiques Dexterity, which is as great as the World conceives it, and the Credit they had at the <hi>Porte</hi> which was not ſmall, fruſtrated the <hi>Spaniards</hi> of their projected ſucceſs; The Knowledge the <hi>Turks</hi> had of this Artifice, allayed th' Heat which began t' inflame them, and retained Patience and Moderation in the Bounds which are not natural unto them.</p>
                  <p>The like Accident hapned during the diſorder of th'Interdict, and a deſign drawn from the ſame Idea, and Caſt in the ſame Mould, and had an End very like it, and fell away in the ſame Manner, whilſt th' ill Intelligence betwixt the Pope and the <hi>Venetians</hi> was much infla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med, and that Matters of all ſides enclined viſibly to a breach. The <hi>Spaniards</hi> ſent the Marquis of St. <hi>Croſs</hi> with forty Gallies into <hi>Alba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>na,</hi> who took and plundered <hi>Duras</hi> a Town belonging to the <hi>Turk,</hi> and of ſome Reputation in that Province, Their intention was not t' Incommodate the <hi>Grand Signior</hi> by the Taking of a Place where they had no Hold, and could not take Root, They prentended only t' awa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken by that Enterprize the proud Enemy, and t'oblige him to Revenge that affront, which could not be executed, but part of the Burthen of the War muſt fall upon the <hi>Venetians,</hi> and that their Countries would make out the firſt Scean where th'Enſigns of the <hi>Turks</hi> Armes would be diſplayed, or at leaſt, that they would paſs by their Gulf t' aſſault the Coaſts of <hi>Naples,</hi> which would give a great Cauſe of Jea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>louſie, and of Expence to the <hi>Venetians;</hi> but the <hi>Grand Signior</hi> ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving given vent to the Mine, no prejudice fell upon them againſt whom it was prepared; But inſtead of aſſaulting the States of the Republique, He ſent t'offer them his Forces againſt the <hi>Spaniards</hi> and the Pope, and Commanded <hi>Glaſſar Baſſa</hi> with five and fifty Gallies t'Advance towards <hi>Gomonicics</hi> near <hi>Corfu,</hi> to Joyn with the General <hi>Paſchaligo</hi> as often as it ſhould pleaſe the <hi>Venetians,</hi> who had not the Will or the Neceſſity to make uſe of a Remedy, whoſe Operation was moſt Dangerous, or t'enter into a Society wherein there was for them but a little Hope, and much Fear.</p>
                  <p>Lets return to our Subject, The Republique ſeeing that th' Affairs of th'<hi>Uſcoques</hi> required a prompt Remedy, and that from that Root might bud, if it were not timely Cut off, ſome great Accident to their prejudice, put themſelves into a poſture to Repreſs it; for that pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe it tryed firſt, as 'tis their Cuſtome, the way of Negotiation and Endeavours, before their Taking up of Armes; but in all their Tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>actions they received Words only without Effect, and perpetual
<pb n="85" facs="tcp:33686:47"/>Changes were given them, ſtudied Invaſions, and diſguiſed Deceits, and no Proceeding was ever more Oblique, more Empty, and more Irreſolute than what was practiſed upon them. When the Republique ſolicited th'Emperour to ſuppreſs th'Attempts of th'<hi>Uſcoques,</hi> and to divert their violences, they were remitted to th' Archdukes as Gover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nours of the Countrey where th' <hi>Uſcoques</hi> dwelt; when they repaired to th' Archdukes for the ſame effect, They anſwered, that it belon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged to th' Emperour, as Soveraign, to provide againſt it, and not to them, who had but a ſubaltern power; when they had brought their Anſwers together, and put them in a condition to make no further uſe of Colluſion and Deceipts, They ſaid, that th' Affair would be beſt determined in a Dyet of <hi>Hungary,</hi> which ſhould be called, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe the place of th' <hi>Uſcoques</hi> Dwellings were dependent, and a Feife of that Kingdome; Sometimes they proteſted, that it dit not belong to them to receive Immediate Addreſſes, but to the Count <hi>Soſimo</hi> and to <hi>Frangipani</hi> as to the particular Lords of thoſe places; That Order was to b' obſerved, and the Degrees of inferiour Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſdictions tryed before Addreſs could be made to the Supreme Authority.</p>
                  <p>But after many Evaſions and Windings, wherewith the Repub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lique was delayed; It declared, that their Patience was abuſed, &amp; that it would aſſume the Right of a Soveraign, and take Reaſon of them, who'd refuſed it. Agents were ſent unto them in the Name of th' Emperour and of the Catholique King, who promiſed that ſatis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction ſhould be given them, and that Complaints ſhould be remo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved. But all their proffers proving to be Wind, and Vain and hollow promiſes, and the Republique having been long and too often Chea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted by them, and preparing in Earneſt to Carry by Force, what they could not Gaine by 'ntreaty, Comiſſaries were ſent upon the places, who Baniſhed or put to Death ſome of the Meaneſt and Leaſt Cul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pable of th'<hi>Uſcoques,</hi> Touched not upon the Chiefs, or upon th'other moſt Conſiderable Members, But Cut off ſome Light and Unpro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fitable Branches of Evill, and left entire the Body and th'other parts of the Tree. And ſo the Diſorder being rather Pruned than Rooted up by this Proceeding, ſprouted more freely than before; And re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſembled to the waters of a ſtopped Torrent, which over-flows with the greater Impetuoſity and Ruine, Th'obſtacle which held them in being taken away, that when the Waters run at Liberty, and their force not provoked by the Reſtraint. There's cauſe of Aſtoniſhment in the Number of Treaties, which were had upon that diſpute, as of the ſucceſs, and as it were of the deſtiny of thoſe Treaties, whereof not one was Executed, and that all of them vaniſhed into ſmoak. There was a Treaty at <hi>Ratisbone,</hi> at <hi>Lints,</hi> at <hi>Pragne,</hi> and principally at <hi>Vienna</hi> of the 12. of <hi>May</hi> 1612. By which it was Agreed that th' Archduke <hi>Ferdinand</hi> ſhould Clear th' <hi>Adriatique</hi> Sea of Pyracies, and t'hinder them of <hi>Segna</hi> to Rob on that Sea; But th'hour of Executi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on on was deferred, and the <hi>Spaniards</hi> had uſe of the Continuance of th'
<pb n="86" facs="tcp:33686:48"/>Evill, and that the Republique ſhould be diverted out of <hi>Italy;</hi> That it might not be forward to look after the <hi>Spaniſh</hi> proceedings in <hi>Piedmont,</hi> and give leſs Heat to th'Affairs of the Duke of <hi>Savoy.</hi> All the Commiſſioners ſent t' execute the Treaties, fell ſick on the way, and were recalled by an affected pretext; And ſome Accident ever Intervened, which Diſappointed the Republique of th' Hopes, wherewith it was ſo long fed, and made to know that Nothing but <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>ron could cure th'Ulcer which had Eaten to the bone, and feſtred by their Connivence.</p>
                  <p>This made the Republique to reſolve upon a War againſt th' Archduke <hi>Ferdinand,</hi> and t'hinder th'Evill from ſtreaming any further to fight in the Spring; for this purpoſe, they commanded <hi>Gradiſque</hi> to be beſieged, and ſpared neither Money nor Men to Recover that place, which had been built againſt th' Invaſion of the <hi>Barbarians</hi> in <hi>Iſtria,</hi> and opened them the Way to the Conqueſt of <hi>Goritia.</hi> The Republique with theſe two places, as with a ſtretched Chain, had ſhut up the paſſage to the <hi>German</hi> Troops, which might have de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcended into the <hi>German</hi> Troops, which might have de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcended into the <hi>Friol</hi> by the Mountains of <hi>Carſo,</hi> and by the River of <hi>Lizonſo.</hi> This conveniency was of great Importance to the <hi>Veneti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans,</hi> and th' opportunity of putting a powerfull Bar betwixt the <hi>Ger<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man</hi> Territories and theirs, whereof they have alwaies Apprehended th'Inundation, gave occaſions to ſome, to ſay, vvho meaſure alwaies the Deſigns of another, by their own Rule, and know no other Law t'Act by but their Profit, That the Proceedings of th' <hi>Uſcoques,</hi> were but the Pretext of that War, and that the Conqueſt of theſe two pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces was the Cauſe. But they who Conſider the preſſing Intereſt the Republique had to repreſs th' Attempts of th' <hi>Uſcoques,</hi> and the peril<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous Conſequences which would ariſe to their prejudice by a longer Patience, will eaſily judge that they could not do leſs; And that in caſe their Conduct was to be blamed, It was for too much flowneſs and flegm, and by diſcovering too great an Inſenſibility, which em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boldned th' Inſolence of their Enemies, and encreaſed th'out-rages that were Acted againſt them. This is not the proper place of repor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting the progreſs of that War, or the different faces that Fortune ſhewed, ſometimes in favour of th'Archdukes, and ſometimes in ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour of the <hi>Venetians,</hi> and of the <hi>Spaniards,</hi> and to repreſent the va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious Means wherewith two powerfull Princes, as hath been ſaid, in Artifices, and politique Prudence, made War, and the Mines and Counter-mines wherewith they mutually aſſaulted and defended themſelves. The Breach made betwixt the <hi>Venetians</hi> and th'Arch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dukes, and the War growing Hot on both ſides, The Duke of <hi>Oſſona,</hi> whoſe humour was naturally troubleſome, and who, as the Natural Heat cleaves to the Radical Humidity, when outward Aliment fails; not finding abroad Matter enough for diſturb<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>nce, raiſed it in the Countries of his Maſter, which was the cauſe of his Ruine. The Duke of <hi>Oſſona,</hi> I ſay, notwithſtanding the Continuation of the Peace with <hi>Spain;</hi> Armes at Sea to Trouble the Republique; Scoures the
<pb n="87" facs="tcp:33686:48"/>Gulf under the conduct of <hi>Alonzo Rivera,</hi> takes away Ships, and to be in a poſture in caſe of neceſſity to be diſavowed, and by an Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tifice worthy of the <hi>Spaniſh</hi> ſpirit, ſets forth this Fleet under his own Enſigns; But th'affairs growing by time more and more grie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vous, and th' Animoſity of the Parties becoming ſtronger by the various accidents, which the War daily produced; He diſplayed the Royal Enſigns, and by a Novelty of latter Times, and unknown to former Ages, makes War without declaring of it, or confeſſing it to be made. That all this was done, It was ſaid, by form of diver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion, and t' exchange it with the <hi>Venetians,</hi> who fomented under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hand, as it hath been reported elſe-where, the Duke of <hi>Savoy,</hi> and paid him every Month a certain ſum of Mony to maintain the War on <hi>Piedmont</hi> ſide; And that the <hi>Spaniards</hi> being exerciſed by that Prince, might not touch upon their Frontiers, unfurniſhed of old Soldiers, and provided onely of Men, who ſerved to make up the Number, as the <hi>Militiaes</hi> of <hi>Italy.</hi> The danger on the Land-ſide, which vexed the <hi>Venetians</hi> more than the <hi>Spaniſh</hi> Enterpriſes at Sea; And the Jealouſie of conſerving their <hi>Campagnia,</hi> wherein they are more ſollicitous than any Perſons of the world, occaſioned, that they reſolved to cauſe ſome form of Accommodation to be propoſed in <hi>Spain,</hi> betwixt th'Arch-dukes and themſelves; And to comprehend alſo the Duke of <hi>Savoy,</hi> with whom they were in ſociety of Inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſts, and in ſome ſort in community of Fortune. It was t'oblige the Catholique King upon the deference, not t'undertake upon their Eſtates, and not to treat them as Enemies, who had choſen him Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>biter of their differences, and committed their affairs ſo freely unto him. This Proceeding might have ſweetned the Courage of the <hi>Spaniards,</hi> it they had been as Magnanimous as Proud, and allai'd th'Indignation they had conceived againſt the <hi>Venetians,</hi> by reaſon of the War they made to the Arch-dukes, and the ſecret Aid they gave to the Duke of <hi>Savoy.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>But in ſtead of ſoftning the <hi>Spaniards</hi> by this great Reſpect which was offered them, and abating of their Animoſity, by a Submiſſion that did them ſo much honour; They 'xpreſſed the greater difficulty, and reſiſted the more t'hear of any Accord. They were Exalted the more for th'Humility of the <hi>Venetians,</hi> and taking them for Perſons that wanted Courage or Power, they handled them with Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proaches and Threatnings, they ſeemed without doubt the more Froward to be the more Entreated; They believed to find leſs re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſtance in making the Conditions of the Treaty, by th' Indiſpoſition they ſhewed in Intermedling in th'Accommodation, and conceived, that they who were in the dirt, would think themſelves happy to be delivered, though they were rudely drawn out, and that there was not a Haven too Incommodious to them, who were ſecured from ſhipwrack. But they were deceived, for th'affairs of the Republique were not then ſo deſperate, as to repair to diſhonorable Means t'eſtabliſh it, and it never fell into ſuch deſperate diſgraces, but that
<pb n="88" facs="tcp:33686:49"/>it was always in power to riſe again with honour. That the <hi>Spa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niards</hi> in effect; were more reſerved than th' had been, t'offend the <hi>Venetians,</hi> and that they did not violate on the Land-ſide the Peace th' had made with them, were the things th' effected, and the principal Intention and Deſign of the <hi>Venetians.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The Propoſition of th' Accommodation being abortive at <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dril,</hi> and th'humour of the <hi>Spaniards</hi> and of the <hi>Venetians</hi> Incompati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble for that time; The differences were remitted to <hi>Rome,</hi> where the difficulties which interrupted the Peace were no more taken away than in <hi>Spain;</hi> for, as the <hi>Pope</hi> was ſuſpected of paſſion in ſavour of the <hi>Spaniards;</hi> and that in th'Affair then acted, there were ſome alſo who believed, That the <hi>Pope</hi> was not dextrous enough to man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>age it, and would not willingly give others the glory to determine it; So th'Inclinations of their Miniſters of State in <hi>Italy,</hi> were too ſtrongly carried to War, that produced a preſent and certain Profit, which they had not in time of Peace, Accompani'd with th'hopes of ſome famous Succeſs, which would have rendred their Admini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtration remarkable. And they endeavoured ſtill to gain Time, and the Game was plaid till the <hi>Spaniſh</hi> Arms had gained Reputation in the taking of <hi>Verecil;</hi> And the fears the <hi>Venetians</hi> had, that the <hi>Spa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niards</hi> would not be reſtrained in the Frontiers of the <hi>Mildnois,</hi> but over-run their Country, being by that Accident Encreaſed, They re-took the Paths they had quitted in relation to <hi>Spain,</hi> and to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>play their old Piece, but much better adjuſted, and with more Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lour, to deſire a Concluſion than they had done the firſt Time. The <hi>Spaniards</hi> alſo gave over their Subtilties &amp; <hi>Rodomontadoes;</hi> The Duke of <hi>Lerma,</hi> a Perſon of a pacifique humour, and who had long ſought for ſome ſpecious way to get off with honour from the War of <hi>Italy,</hi> embraced the Conjuncture; It could not be more advantagious to th'Affairs of his Maſter, becauſe the Peace came after the Victory, nor more favourable to his particular Affairs, becauſe by that Means he diſcharged <hi>Don Pedro</hi> of <hi>Toledo</hi> from the command of th'Army, who was of a contrary faction, and began to leſſen the Dukes Cabi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>net power, wherein th'other was in his proper Sphere, by the glory of his Actions done in the Field. He receives then with great Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>probation the Propoſals of the <hi>Venetians,</hi> promiſeth to remember th' honour they did his Maſter, by the moſt profitable and moſt ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norable Conditions he could procure them, and no Treaty ever had th' Apparance of a more certain Concluſion that this.</p>
                  <p>But as Tempeſts are not more frequent at Sea, than Revolutions at War, and that the Conſtitution of <hi>Piedmont</hi> had that in particular in it, As t'obſerve the form of the <hi>French</hi> Government, and was dependent upon th'Inconſtancy and Changes of a Court, which at that time was more Changeable and Uncertain than ever; It hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned, that the Marſhal of <hi>Anore,</hi> a paſſionate friend for the <hi>Spaniards,</hi> and a great Promoter of their Intereſts being ſuddenly killed; And the Spring he held ſhut up of the principal Reliefs, which ought
<pb n="89" facs="tcp:33686:49"/>t'have paſſed to the Duke of <hi>Savoy,</hi> being opened by his death; ſuch great numbers of <hi>French</hi> paſſed into <hi>Piedmont,</hi> That the Duke found himſelf in a condition to make his Enemies Army to quit the Field, which the Siege of <hi>Verceil</hi> had much difordered; That by taking of many Towns, he took from them the Remainders of their Army; That he was ready to force into the <hi>Milanois;</hi> and that 'twas in his power to give fear to the City of <hi>Milan,</hi> if the courſe of the Victory had not been interrupted from <hi>France,</hi> and the Thunder reſtrained that was ready to break out on the <hi>Spaniards;</hi> And Fortune that had ill uſed the <hi>Venetians</hi> before <hi>Gradiſque,</hi> began to declare in their fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour, and a glorious Re-enforcement of <hi>Hollanders,</hi> under the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duct of <hi>Count John</hi> of <hi>Naſſau,</hi> promiſed them an happy ſucceſs, and quick Reducement of that place, which had coſt them great ſums of Mony, and much Forein and Inteſtine Blood.</p>
                  <p>In this Change of fortune, and in this new face of Affairs, the <hi>Ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>netians</hi> changed proceedings in relation to the <hi>Spaniards,</hi> and took off the Maſque under which they then concealed their Intentions, which never were, That the <hi>Spaniards,</hi> ſo powerful and formidable in <hi>Italy,</hi> by reaſon of th'Eſtates they there poſſeſſed, ſhould become the Judges of the Quarrels there rais'd, and add to the Powers they had in <hi>Italy</hi> th'Authority of determining the Differences, and to regulate th' Affairs, wherein they'd no power; They commanded it then to be told the Catholique King, That their Ambaſſador had no command to make other addreſſes t'him, than to know his Senſe, and take his Advice upon the Matter of the War of <hi>Gradiſque,</hi> and that of <hi>Piedmont;</hi> And that they 'ntended to conſult him, as a Friend in that Matter, but not to refer the Deciſion t' him, and to conſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tute him for Judge. And ſo giving the <hi>Spaniſh</hi> King thanks in mag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nificent Terms, and in words of great Reſpect, which they've ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſtomed to lay down in abundance upon things they've no Will to grant, They diſappointed the <hi>Spaniards</hi> of their deſign, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved for <hi>France</hi> th' Honour, the <hi>Spaniards</hi> had paſſionately de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſired; So that in the whole courſe of this Intrigue, and in all this Cabinet-War, the Field remained to the <hi>Venetians,</hi> who found not nevertheleſs their Account in <hi>France,</hi> but either th'Intereſt of the State, or the Genius of the Miniſters of State, too much carried t' oblige <hi>Spain;</hi> or for fear of diſobliging it; Was the cauſe, that too great a reſpect was had to the Dignity of that Crown, or too little to that of the Republique, and to th'Intereſts of the Duke of <hi>Savoy.</hi> Th'Emperors and th'Arch-dukes diſocntentments had upon this Peace againſt the <hi>Spaniards,</hi> is not to b' here concealed, nor their Complaints againſt and Accommodation, that had not better'd their Condition, but had return'd them to the poſture they were in by the Treaty of <hi>Vienna,</hi> and had put them into th'Haven, from whence they were put out, after th'expence and hazards of an unprofitable Navigation. Thus the <hi>Spaniards</hi> have accuſtomed, to ſacrifize to their Intereſts ſome of their beſt friends, and to ſtrain them to their

Th'uſe of this Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tifice was not new in the world, nor th'Invention of the <hi>Venetians;</hi> It was practiſed long ago by <hi>Charls</hi> th'Eighth, to divert <hi>Henry</hi> the Seventh the King of <hi>England</hi> from relieving the Duke of <hi>Britany,</hi> to whom h' had a purpoſe to make War; T'allay then the ſtorm that might ariſe from that ſide, and ſtop the Relief which <hi>Henry</hi> might bring or ſend in favour of his Neighbour, <hi>Charls</hi> made a ſhew of deſiring the Peace, and offered to ſubmit t'<hi>Henry</hi> the diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rences h' had with the Duke, and t' acknowledge him Arbiter and Mediator of the Quarrel. <hi>Charls</hi> with this delicate Bait and ſubtil Charm of Honour, diſarm'd <hi>Henry</hi>'s warlick ſpirit, who was fully engaged with affections and inclinations t' Aid the Duke of <hi>Britany;</hi> But <hi>Charls</hi> made ſo powerful and quick a Levy, and raiſed ſuch great Forces, that the Duke was over-run before notice was taken of it in <hi>England,</hi> That <hi>Charls</hi> was entred into his Country with an Army, and the Tragedy ended before it was known that the firſt Act was plaid.</p>

                  <head type="sub">Some Rules that Princes, and eſpecially they that are Weak, ought t' obſerve, when they have need to make uſe of the Relief of their Friends.</head>
                  <p>IN the precedent Diſcourſe hath been ſeen th'unhappy Deſtiny of Weak Princes, when they are aſſaulted by Powerful Princes, and the various Artifices exerciſed t'hinder or ſlacken the Reliefs, which might come to them from their Friends. But ſince 'tis neceſſary, that there be ſuch Princes in the world, and that in the diſtribution of the parts of that little Engine, for which men give themſelves ſo much Labour, and make ſo great a noiſe, Equality hath not been obſerved; 'Tis of neceſſity that the Weaker follow the General Law, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>main the Prey of the Stronger, wh' aſſault them, or that they ſeek protection from them wh' are able to give it, and ſecure themſelves under the ſhadow of their Authority, or by the force of their Arms; ſome Rules are to b'obſerved, as of Importance to be known; The firſt is; That they make the ſtrongeſt preparation in their power t'oppoſe th'Enemy that comes t'aſſault them, and to reſiſt his firſt Impetuoſity, which ordinarily is the moſt violent, and put by their firſt ſtrokes, which are ever the moſt Dangerous.</p>
                  <p>For this purpoſe, and in this publick Neceſſity, they<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>re to ſell or engage their beſt and moſt precious things; To ſink deep into the purſes of their Friends, and upon their Subjects to make great Le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vies; And 'tis better for their Subjects t'endure a little blood-letting, and for a ſhort time, by their Prince, than totally and for ever ruin'd by strangers; And a waſted Country, as 'tis ſaid, is better for him
<pb n="91" facs="tcp:33686:50"/>than a loſt Country; and Subjects a little plundred, than Subjects conſtrained to change Maſter; And though they cannot long bear that extraordinary Levy, nor reſiſt that exceſſive Charge, It may fall out, that th'Heat of th'Aſſailant may grow cold by a greater Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſtance made on the ſudden than was expected; And may not b' offended at Propoſals of Accommodation, and that a door b' opened unto them to get our with Honour from an Enterprize, whoſe Beginnings being unhappy, the Progreſs might b' abated without doing more than making of a Noiſe, and may return to th'Haven without other danger than the fear of a Tempeſt.</p>
                  <p>Or if th' Enemy do not withdraw upon th' ill uſage Fortune affords them at the firſt Attempt, and refuſe to quit the place, or to retire; In gaining of time they 've done much, which is the great Remedy of Unfortunate and Weak perſons, and gives Means to their Friends to come to their Relief, and to bring them freſh Troops, wherewith they may not onely maintain themſelves, but cauſe the face of War to change, and turn the Defence int' an Aſſault, and become th'Aſſailants of their Enemies. The Duke of <hi>Savoy,</hi> Grand-father of the preſent Duke, did the like, ſince the death of the late King, in the Wars the <hi>Spaniards</hi> made him, or H' had been ſuddenly over-run at the firſt ſight, and ſwallowed by the <hi>Spaniſh</hi> powerful Armies, wherewith the Governour of <hi>Milan</hi> en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tred <hi>Piedmont,</hi> and gave fear t'all <hi>Italy,</hi> but to that Prince; And yet, with that wiſe and bold proceeding, he not onely received and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſted their firſt aſſaults, but gave them affronts; And precedent it hath been obſerved, that after the loſs of <hi>Verceil,</hi> which had it been well defended might have been kept, ſtrengthned by that fair and flouriſhing Relief <hi>Sir</hi> of <hi>Eſdiguieres</hi> brought unto it, who put the <hi>Spaniards</hi> upon the Defenſive, and compelled them to deſire Peace, which was concluded at <hi>Paris</hi> to their Advantage.</p>
                  <p>The ſecond Rule is, That as great ſums of Money are to be ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pended, and a great Army to be raiſed, 'tis of great importance to make them timely, and not t'expoſe them to th'hazard of ſurpriſes, which being dangerous in all ſorts of affairs, are much more in the buſineſs of War, and d'ordinarily make breaches, by which ill fortune enters ſo far into the Country, That it proves a difficult matter to drive it out; And it often falls out, that they die of thoſe ſtrokes, or are long ſick of them; And 'tis what ſometimes hath been to be deſired by way of Addition, to the Wiſdom of the <hi>Venetians,</hi> and to their excellent Conduct; Their Hiſtorians alſo confeſs, That one of the cauſes of the loſs of the Kingdom of <hi>Cyprus,</hi> was the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lays they uſed in preparing againſt the Storm which they ſaw coming. And in the Motions, which troubled <hi>Italy</hi> about the Suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſion of the laſt Duke of <hi>Mantoua,</hi> we've ſeen them Arm ſlow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lier than was neceſſary for their very deſign, and have ſuſpended many times th' Orders and Commiſſions they 'd given for the War, upon uncertain and wild reports of a Treaty of Peace, and
<pb n="92" facs="tcp:33686:51"/>were onely a ſtudied Deceit, and an affected Artifice of the <hi>Spa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niards,</hi> for to poſſeſs them with a coldneſs and relaxation of ſpirit; 'Tis certain at leaſt, That if after the King had forced his paſſage at <hi>Suza,</hi> and taken away the Barrier that ſhut up their Entry into <hi>Italy,</hi> They had not recalled th'Orders given to their General t'enter into <hi>Cremona,</hi> They had taken of the <hi>Spaniards</hi> ſome eminent Advantage, whilſt they wanted Forces, failed of Courage, and th'Inclinations of the people were adverſe unto them.</p>
                  <p>Who can, I ſay, doubt, but if they had taken poſſeſſion of <hi>Cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mona,</hi> which opened her Arms unto them, and breathed after ſo eaſie a Yoke, as theirs; but that they had greatly fortifi'd the Party which they favoured, and had obliged, it may be, by that Declara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, the <hi>Spaniards</hi> t'have obſerved the Peace of <hi>Sutza,</hi> and t'have cauſed to be ſent to the Duke of <hi>Mantoua</hi> th'Inveſtiures Accorded by that Treaty, rather than t'have ſhut themſelves up betwixt two ſo conſiderable Powers as <hi>France</hi> and <hi>Venice,</hi> and ſome other Forces, which <hi>Venice</hi> might have drawn t' its aſſiſtance? or if the War had re-kindled, as it did the following year, and the <hi>Spaniards</hi> touched with th'Affronts they received from all parts, have been forward at any price to take revenge of the ſhame by Arms; The War without all doubt had taken another form, If the <hi>Venetians</hi> had been Engaged in it; <hi>Mantoua</hi> in Apparance had not been loſt; All the deſignes of th'Enemies had been Abortive; And inſted of th'unhappy ſucceſs of th'Expedition of <hi>Valeſe,</hi> for being undertaken too late and with precipitaion, The Republique had ſeen the fruits ripen at leaſure, if it had been timely acted, of ſo generous a Deſign, and without much hazard; Nor had it been for that Action the more Hated of th'Houſe of <hi>Austria;</hi> It had been the more reſpected; And all <hi>Italy</hi> had taken the greater courage for defence of the common Liberty, if it had had before their Eyes ſo great an Example of Courage from them, who give every day ſo great Examples of their Wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom. But however, 'tis the Lot of Human Wiſdom to be ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times defective, or rather, 'tis the property of Evil Events to b'al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways attributed t'Unreaſonable Cauſes; or elſe 'tis the Nature of all th'affairs that are put in Deliberation t'have many faces and reaſons of all ſides, which encline t'Act or not t'Act one manner or other; Right of Providence, which governs the World, to fruſtrate, or cauſe to b'obſerved, as it ſhall ſeem good, the reaſons of th'effects in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended, and of the promiſed ſucceſs.</p>
                  <p>The third Rule ſhall be, That if the Prince, who is aſſaulted, en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavours t'execute what hath been adviſed him to do, and yet ſhall have need of Relief from his Allies to make th'Evil to ceaſe, or to ſtop th'Enemies further progreſs, He muſt make uſe of their Forces for Diverſion, and cauſe them to march into th' Enemies Country, if he be not over-preſſed in his own Country, and if th'Evil he feels or fears may attend that Remedy. By that means he may eaſe his
<pb n="93" facs="tcp:33686:51"/>Country of them, who would have laid it waſte, and had ſworn the ruine of it, and will ſecure it alſo from the ſpoil of Auxiliaries, which cannot b' avoided; And which may properly be compared to Phyſicians, who cannot cure the body without th' uſe of it, nor drive away th'ill humours which cauſe Alteration, without the diſordering of it, and without leaving alſo ſometimes ſome Ill Impreſſion. As to the ſucceſs of this Diverſion, 'tis Impoſſible, but it muſt proſper, and have th'effect it Aims at, becauſe it hath the character and mark of efficacious diverſions, and to b'executed upon a Country, which is ordinarily of greater Importance, and of ſtronger Concernment, being his own, to th'Enemy, than that from which they would force him; And there's no apparance, That a wiſe Phyſician will neglect th'Heart, or ſome other Noble part, t'intend the cure of a light Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuſion, or of ſome ſmal Scratch.</p>
                  <p>Let's alſo ſay, before return be made t'our principal Subject, and for the better clearing the Matter of Diverſion, which will not much divert us, and is a Neighbour to't, That one of the moſt memorable and the moſt judicious Diverſions, which the paſt Age hath ſeen, was that which <hi>Francis</hi> the Firſt made upon the <hi>Spaniards,</hi> when the Conſtable of <hi>Bourbon,</hi> the Marquis of <hi>Peſcary,</hi> and th'other Chiefs of th'Imperial Army, came t'aſſault <hi>Provance;</hi> Inſtead of marching ſtreight t' oppoſe them, and to fight them in his Kingdom; He marched quickly with his Army int' <hi>Italy,</hi> and fell upon the State of <hi>Milan,</hi> and upon the Country in moſt favour with th'Emperor, and upon the parts of all the reſt of his Eſtates, which were deareſt t' him next to <hi>Spain;</hi> nor was he diſappointed of his Thoughts; for th'Imperial Army failed not at the firſt Noiſe of that Expedition to quit <hi>Provance,</hi> and to march towards <hi>Italy</hi> with ſo ſtrange a Nimble<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, and ſuch an Incredible Diligence, That it prevented our Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rival in the State of <hi>Milan,</hi> and gave means to recruit and fortifie ſome places, which were the ſecurity of the reſt.</p>
                  <p>That if the Subſequent Succeſs was as fatal to us, as the firſt fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vourable; And if the Cauſe of that War was Ended in th' Impri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonment of King <hi>Francis,</hi> and by the Ruine of his Army; This Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grace ought not to b' Attributed to the Nature of the Diverſion, which was very pertinent; nor a Prudential Cauſe charged with the production of a Malignant Effect, which proceeded from another Cauſe; This Diſgrace, I ſay, is to b'attributed to the deſign of For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune, which undertook to mortifie <hi>French-men</hi> by th'ill Conduct of their Prince, and by the faults of His Miniſters of State, and by that unhappy and undiſcreet Diverſion, which he made upon the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom of <hi>Naples,</hi> whither he ſent the Duke of <hi>Albany</hi> with a part of his Army; For beſides the great Weakneſs it brought to the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mainder of his Forces, and the fair Game it made for his Enemies t'advance for th'Aſſault, as they failed not to do in that Weakneſs; He conſidered not, that the Kingdom of <hi>Naples</hi> being leſs Impor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tant to th'Emperour, and of leſs Eſteem with him, than the State
<pb n="94" facs="tcp:33686:52"/>of <hi>Milan,</hi> His Army could not abandon the <hi>Milanois</hi> to Relieve <hi>Naples.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The Fourth Rule, That if an inevitable Neceſſity b' upon a Prince, to procure Forein Forces to march int' His Country, and ſtrengthen his Army; It may b' of great advantage t' him t'have need onely of moderate Forces, and ſuch as b' inferior t' his; That he may always give the Law, and receive no Jealouſie from them, leſt they ſhould put him int' a kind of Subjection in the ſight of his Subjects, and abate the glory of Authority which governs his Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, and th'opinion of his Greatneſs, by that mark of Dependency, wherein he muſt inavoidably fall upon the Reception of ſtr<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>nge Armies. I ſpeak not of other Inconveniencies, which may ariſe up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on th'introduction of Strangers into a Country, and particularly, if Ambition enters with the Power, or if the Beauty of the Country, or Riches of th'Inhabitants, may ſerve them for Temptation to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire it, who being born under a Rigorous Climate, and in Salvage Countries, are but too much tempted to change Dwellings, and to gain Richer Habitations. <hi>Philip,</hi> father of <hi>Alexander,</hi> by ſuch an Invitation, attempted the Liberty of <hi>Grece,</hi> whereof the <hi>Romans,</hi> as hath been obſerved, made a Conqueſt. That the <hi>Goths,</hi> the <hi>Vandals,</hi> and other <hi>Septentrionals,</hi> have poſſeſſed themſelves of their Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tries, who called them to their Relief; And that ſix thouſand <hi>Turks</hi> marching from <hi>Aſia</hi> into <hi>Europe,</hi> to ſerve th'Emperours of <hi>Conſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinople,</hi> charmed with the ſweetneſs and felicity of that pleaſant Country, invited their Country-men t'eſtabliſh themſelves in <hi>Eu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rope;</hi> And it was the firſt cauſe of the Revolution of that Empire. Wherefore wiſe Princes and Republiques, well inſtructed in th'Art of Governing, have at all times avoided th'Uſe of ſo dangerous a Remedy, and th'Exerciſe of a Means ſo full of Jealouſie, as th'In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troduction of a great Forein Army into their Country. In the War which th'antient <hi>Romans</hi> made againſt <hi>Pyrrhus,</hi> and when by the gain of ſome Battels, that brave Prince had ſhaken the foundations of that Republique, They refuſed the <hi>Cathaginian</hi> Army, ſent to their Relief under the command of <hi>Mago,</hi> and reſolved in that great Extremity t' owe onely to Virtue and to their own Powers, the Re-eſtabliſhment of their Affairs, and the Return of their Fortune.</p>
                  <p>After the Rout of <hi>Giragdade,</hi> and the ſad ſucceſs of that Battel, which at one Blow took from the <hi>Venetians</hi> all their Lands; The Republique would not accept th' offer of Forces made them by <hi>Bajazet</hi> the Second, nor uſe that Means to deliver themſelves of th'ill fortune that purſued them, which was violent, and to get out of a Precipice which was dangerous; 'Tis certain, that their ill for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune could not be greater, nor the Precipice deeper; All <hi>Chriſten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome</hi> was combined againſt it, and a powerful victorious Army; And it had loſt an Army, when it was impoſſible for them to raiſe an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other; Terror and Deſpair entred int' all their Towns, upon the
<pb n="95" facs="tcp:33686:52"/>Noiſe of this Diſgrace; And by a ſtrange Motion of Prudence, and an Extraordinary Act of Policy, it was conſtrained t' adviſe their Subjects t'open their Gates to the Victorious, and to do that with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out breach of Duty, or guilt of Treaſon, which the Conſternation they were fallen into, and the Current of th'Enemies Victory would have forced upon them; And yet, choſe rather to ſeek ſafery and reſurrection in its Wiſdom, and in the ſole Means left to reſtore it ſelf, by th'Imploying of all their ſtrength, for the Diſunion of the Confederates, and Breach of the League, than to draw into their Country thoſe barbarous Soldiers, from whence they could not withdraw them when they would, or t'expoſe <hi>Italy</hi> to the ſame conditon, the Neighbour Provinces to <hi>Conſtantinople</hi> were in, under the <hi>Turk,</hi> as hath been formerly ſpoken.</p>
                  <p>In the growth of Hereſie in this Kingdom, and of the firſt fires which burnt it for the matter of Religion; <hi>Francis</hi> the ſecond re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſed <hi>Philip</hi> his Brother in Law, who fearing that the Contagion of th'Errour and Treaſon, which reigned amongſt us, ſhould paſs into <hi>Flanders,</hi> and complete the Corruption of his Subjects, that had then taken ſome taſte of it, ſent to make offer of all his Forces to fight them; The duke of <hi>Alva</hi> alſo, after h' had obtained in the <hi>Low-Countries</hi> many happy Succeſſes againſt the Rebels of his Maſter, beſought <hi>Charls</hi> the Ninth to give him leave to bring 15000 Foot and 5000 Horſe, all Men of War, and accuſtomed to Victory, to reduce his Subjects t'Obedience.</p>
                  <p>But the King, by th'advice of his Council, refuſed alſo that offer and would not in accepting of it, either diſcover the Weakneſs of his Reign, or give to the factious Religionaries more pretence to call Strangers to their Relief, and to them the more colour of coming into his Country; or t'introduce into th'Heart of his Kingdom an Army of valiant Perſons, whom He could not eaſily drive away, who would have demanded places of ſecurity for their Entry, and Immenſe Dammages for their Return, and might in time be the cauſe of a more dificult and longer War than what troubled him. That whereas a part onely of his Subjects were in queſtion, and that the Rebels to be reduc'd to reaſon, made a profeſſion of fidelity, and by conſequence might eaſily be diſarmed by Indulgence, when it ſhould appear too dangerous to repreſs them by Force; H' had been under the Neceſſity of a defence againſt his Subjects and Neighbours, and to fight Enemies, wh' having ſome Title of Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtice, and making War without Remorſe or Scruple of Conſcience, would have made it the more violent, and the leſs ſuſceptible of Accommodation.</p>
                  <p>From what hath been now ſaid, a freſh Rule to clear it may be raiſed; That an Army of Forein Forces to be drawn int' a Princes Country, and in ſo great a number, as to give the Law, or raiſe Jea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>louſie in him that Imploys them, is to b' avoided; And that H' ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve, alſo if it be poſſible, two things; T'Endeavour, that the ſtranger
<pb n="96" facs="tcp:33686:53"/>Forces depend more upon the Prince that calls them in and pays them, than upon him who leads them in and commands them; And that their Relation t' him be ſtronger and more abſolute, than their Dependency upon their Commander. Th' other thing is, t' hinder their Conjunction in a Body, and to keep them always ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver'd, if there be not ſpecial cauſe to draw them together; and to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyn them. The <hi>Venetians</hi> not long ſince Endeavoured to divide the Troops, which the <hi>Sir</hi> of <hi>Roquelaure</hi> brought them, and to take the Command from him: And the <hi>Hollanders</hi> laboured to do the like to the <hi>Count</hi> of <hi>Mansfield,</hi> after he had Relieved <hi>Bergenopſon;</hi> But they met with bold ſpirits that reſiſted their Artifices, and defeated the ſubtil Attempts of their Policy; 'Tis true, That this Trial is not to be made upon any Perſons, but Caſual Chiefs, who depend onely up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on their Sword, and upon the Prince that Imploys them, and having drawn together ſuch Troops by their Induſtry and Credit, maintain them alſo in Dependency by their Authority and Addreſs.</p>
                  <p>As to th'Impeding the Conjunction of Forces, that might make great and conſiderable Bodies, 'Tis an undubitable Means to divert the Diſorder, and to prevent the Licenſe, which of cuſtom grows in Mercenary ſouls, from th'Hopes of Impunity; As th'hopes of Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>punity are uſually ingendred from the multitude of Culpable per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons: From this Root, Sedition and Mutinies have often budded in th' Antient and Modern Armies; And the boldneſs of the <hi>Pretorian</hi> Troops, did heretofore ſtream from this ſpring, in killing and chooſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing their Emperours, and abuſed too often the Royal Purple, in taking it away, and giving it to whom they pleaſed, by that blind incitement, which animates Courages, and being not Regulated by Reaſon, are not reſtrained by Reſpect or Fear. <hi>Seianus,</hi> the greateſt Favorite of all Ages, and the firſt Example the world hath ſeen of exceſſive Favour, Having the Command of the <hi>Pretorian</hi> Troops, reſolved to draw them together, To render himſelf the more for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>midable by the quick and preſent Relief had in hand of the beſt Sol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diers of th'Empire; The Soldiers provided their Quarters, and drew them into the form of a Cittadel to Command <hi>Rome,</hi> and t'hold, in ſubjection the Capital City of the World. The great number of <hi>Janiſſaries,</hi> which the <hi>Gram Signi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>r</hi> keeps at <hi>Conſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinople,</hi> is the cauſe of the Tumults which often ariſe there, and of th'Inſolencies they commit in that City, which are extended ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times to the violating of the <hi>Seraglio,</hi> the <hi>Grand Signior</hi>'s Palace, To compel their Prince to deliver unto them his Favourites, To do Juſtice, as they ſay, upon them, and not to ſpare his Perſon, but even to kill him. That if the Prince ought t'avoid with great care, and for the Conſequences which have been repreſented, the draw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing together of a great Number of his ſubject Soldiers, H' ought much more to be careful to keep them ſover'd, ſo long as it may con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veniently be done, who depend not upon Him; but by the conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration, as ſtrangers of their Pay; And reſpect him at the Rate
<pb n="96" facs="tcp:33686:53"/>they fear Him, and fear Him at the Rate of his power to Puniſh them.</p>
                  <p>The ſixth Rule is; That a Petty Prince Aſſaulted by a Greater, wh' hath need of a more prompt and Efficacious Remedy, than Diverſion, againſt the Violence that oppreſſeth him, before He reſolves to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive int' His Countrey a Forein Army, ſtronger than his own, and to give him place if they be demanded for Security and Retreat, ought to make a juſt and exact Compariſon of th'Evills, to which he doth expoſe Himſelf in the doing of it, and of them, he muſt of ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſity fall into, if He do it not; ought t'Examin Coldly and without Paſſion, the Nature and Circumſtances of th' Affair which vexeth him; The conditions of his Enemies and of his Friends; The Faith and Ambition of all of them; The conveniency of his Countries or of any of his places for them; And the Compariſion and Examina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion being made of th'Inconveniencies, he muſt run of all ſides, H' ought to make Choice of the leaſt offenſive; H' ought t' Agree with his Enemies, if they are tractable, or make uſe of the Relief of his Friends, if they are Faithfull; And when H' hath made a good Choice, and ſhall put into th' Haven without Shipwrack, He muſt praiſe God for it, as his peculiar Grace and Extraordinary Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour.</p>
                  <p>The laſt Rule is; That in General, a Prince ought if He can t'have one or two Fortreſſes, for the ſecurity of his Countrey, and to ſerve for a ſtop to the Forces which may over-run him, and to th'Invaſions of an Enemy, who without Impediment may ſuddenly become Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter of it. For example, The Duke of <hi>Sax</hi> at <hi>Dreſde</hi> and <hi>Vittemberge;</hi> The Marquis of <hi>Brandburge</hi> at <hi>Cuſtrin</hi> and <hi>Spando;</hi> The <hi>Lantgrave</hi> of <hi>Heſs</hi> at <hi>Castel</hi> and <hi>Sigenham.</hi> In theſe places Conſiſts without all doubt the ſafety of their Countries; and without them they would become the Prey of the firſt Poſſeſſor; As are the Countries of ſome other Princes of <hi>Germany,</hi> wh' have no Fortreſſes upon their Fron<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiers; And what had become, I pray, of <hi>Montferrat,</hi> but for the <hi>Cita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>delle</hi> of <hi>Caſall,</hi> that Excellent Piece, which had defeated ſo many and ſo great Armies of th' Enemies, whoſe Situation and the Jealouſie given by its ſtrength, have invited to beſiege it?</p>

If their Eſtates be little, and their Revenue ſmall, they ought not to Charge their Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tries with many ſtrong Places, nor t' imitate Intemperate perſons, wh' Eating t' exceſs, Cannot Digeſt what they Eat, and fill them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves with ſo great a Quantity of ill Humours, that the Natural Heat cannot diſſolve them, or diſcharge the body of that plentifull ſpring of Incommodities, and of that fruitfull Mine of Maladies. The deſire of many Fortreſſes ariſeth from an irregular Appetite, and from an Intemperate ſpirit, which the Prince being unable to finiſh,
<pb n="98" facs="tcp:33686:54"/>and to furniſh with neceſſary Proviſſions, or to keep the Garriſons well manned and paid; ſome of them are loſt by ſome of the named Defects; And it happens alſo that th'Enemy upon the Taking of a Fort finiſheth the Fortifications and Garriſons, and by that means makes himſelf ſo ſtrong an Eſtabliſhment in that Countrey, and takes ſo deep Rooting, that 'tis a difficult Buſineſs to get him thence, but by a Treaty of Peace, and by that Laſſitude and <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  <p>From this Principle alſo is derived another Inconveniency that puts the whole State in danger, and Cuts the Sinews and Nerves, which Bind and Joyn the parts together; That th' Exceſſive Number of Garriſons the Prince is obliged to keep, is the cauſe that He becomes Weak when he is to draw into the Field; And that th' Enemy be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Maſter without reſiſtance of the flat Countrey, all places at once are blocked up and loſt, and at Conteſt, which ſhall begin to Render, for want of an Army to relieve them, and t' avoid th' ill uſage of an unneceſſary Defence, and having no reaſonable Means of ſecurity, can have no Thoughts but of periſhing a little later than others, and of Conſuming th'Aſſailants by delay.</p>
                  <p>The Dukes of <hi>Savoy</hi> are fallen into this Inconveniences; In having a great Number of Fortreſſes, and the greateſt part of them Accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panied with ſome of the Defects which have been repreſented; The Situation truly of their Countrey, and particularly of <hi>Piedmont,</hi> ſhut up in the midſt of the Countreys of very great and formidable Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, as a King of <hi>France</hi> and a King of <hi>Spain,</hi> hath contributed much to this Diſorder; And that ſome of the places have been often taken; And 'tis impoſſible but that amongſt ſo many weak Forts in their Countr<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

The Duke of <hi>Rohan</hi> hath alſo obſerved in his Remembrances, That one of the Ruinous Cauſes of th' <hi>Hugonot</hi> party, and Principal Means of the diſſolution of that great Body, was the great Number of their ſtrong Cities; And that by Endeavouring to ſave them, they loſt them all; And unable to diſpute the Field, with the Kings Armies, as it for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merly had Done, That they fell under the Virtue and Power of the King. It belongs only to the <hi>Flemings</hi> and to th'<hi>Hollanders</hi> t'have their Countries full of ſtrong Holds, and all thoſe ſtrong Holds Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned with powerfull Garriſons, and at the ſame Time to raiſe great Armies.</p>
                  <p>But as to the <hi>Flemings;</hi> Thought their Countries be of the beſt of the World, and are called th'<hi>Indies</hi> of <hi>Christendom,</hi> by reaſon of their Wealth; It had been quickly drawn out and Left Drye, but for th'Influence of <hi>Spain,</hi> and th'Abundance of both <hi>Indies</hi> laid out to nouriſh the War, and to ſupport the Motions which have vexed that people for many years; Nor hath it been alwaies in their power to furniſh the Neceſſities of that War, and th'Hunger of that inſatiable
<pb n="99" facs="tcp:33686:54"/>Monſter. And we've often ſeen th' Armies of that Countrey pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſh for want of Moneys, and from that want Conſiderable Bodies of Mutineers t' ariſe, as ſo many Republiques, which ſubſiſted by Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der and Diſcipline without Rejoyning to the body from whence they drew away, till payment was made of what was due to them, and ſo thereupon deſiſting from being their Princes Creditors, they re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turned to the Duty of Subjects.</p>
                  <p>As to th' <hi>Hollanders,</hi> who knows not alſo that they 've not been alwaies in their preſent Condition, nor ever had ſo many ſtrong Holds or ſo well Manned as now they Have; That they've been long upon the Defenſive, and with ſo Mean an Army, As that they believed to Gain what they did not Loſe, and t'overcome effective<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly when they were not overcome; It was at that time when they ſubſiſted only by the good pleaſure of others, and by the ſubventions and Reliefs which came to them from <hi>France, England,</hi> and <hi>Germany;</hi> when th' had not made Acquaintance with th' <hi>Indies,</hi> or Robbed the <hi>Spaniſh</hi> Fleets, or ſailed into the <hi>Levant</hi> Seas, but under the Ban<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner of <hi>France;</hi> when they were not Maſters of Trade and Naviga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, as they are at this day; but ſince the Sea hath Enriched them of all ſides, and hath cauſed great Wealth to come to them from all parts of the World, 'Tis no wonder if their Forts and Armies are ſupplied with all Neceſſaries; And being ſo great Husbands, and ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king ſo true Meaſure of all things, which is the property of Repub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liques, They never fall ſhort in their Military Expeditions; And yet, 'tis not to be denied, but that they cannot draw their Armies ſeveral years together into the Field without being weary of it, and conſuming of their Treaſury, and that they will have need of reſt and breath, or to receive Contribution from abroad, as they have of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten received from <hi>France.</hi>

                        </gap>ſses</hi> from th'Houſe of <hi>Auſtria</hi> of <hi>Germany,</hi> and the defection of the <hi>Flemings</hi> from th'Houſe of <hi>Spain,</hi> are ſuch cleer proofs of this Truth, that others are not to be Looked after. Sometimes theſe Diſorders are nothing but bare Threatnings from God to Direct Princes, and the People wh' have offended him, to Repentance; And then, what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever Diſpoſition there may be in th'Inclination of Second Cauſes, and how ſteep ſoever the deſcent or Precipitation, yet the Fall is pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vented, as by Miracle, the diſorder of Affairs is reconciled againſt all hopes, as th'Intrigue of a Comedy, and Things return to their firſt Beeing, without diſcovery almoſt of the Way of their Return. <hi>France</hi> hath made many Experiences of this Truth, without ſpeaking of other Countries. The moſt Modern of all ſhall here content me, The deſcent of th'<hi>Engliſh</hi> in th'Iſland of <hi>Rhé.</hi> There was no Appa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence to the contrary, but that their Deſign ought t'have been Exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuted, and they t'have been Maſters of that Iſland; And therefore if it had hapned, It had been a difficult Matter to reſiſt the Tempeſt that then Threatned us, and to ſecure from Loſs Provinces of this Kingdom.</p>
                  <p>The Mouths of the Rivers of <hi>Loyre</hi> and <hi>Garronne</hi> which th'Engliſh Naval Army ought t'have ſeized upon, and by conſequence all Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner of Communication ſhut up from thence to <hi>Britany, Poitou,</hi> and <hi>Guienna.</hi> A conſiderable Army ready to Joyn with th Engliſh, and marching from <hi>Languedock</hi> had been Encreaſed by a great Number of <hi>Hugonot</hi> Forces, that would have joyned with them, as a River ſwells in Rowling, by many Rivers that do diſcharge themſelves into it; A great Captain at th'head of them to make uſe of all Advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tages they ſhould gain, and all that Fortune ſhould offer them, and many other Circumſtances formed a very dangerous Conjuncture againſt <hi>France.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>'Tis not to be doubted, but that the Virtue and Fortune of the King, The Prudence, The Courage and th'Activity of his Miniſters of State, and the Forces of a powerfull Kingdome might have Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rected all that this Conjuncture had of Malignant and deplorable in it; But 'tis alſo to be Confeſſed, that they could not have been put to a ſtronger proof, and that Leſs than that, was not Convenient to break the Deſigns of the Rebellion, and t'hinder th'Eſtabliſhment of it in
<pb n="101" facs="tcp:33686:55"/>the State, which might have laſted as long as the Monarchy. But the Love of God to <hi>France</hi> was ſo great, as not to permit it to come to ſuch a proof; And the Glory of the King was to be raiſed upon a fairer Occaſion than the Neceſſity of the Defence. For th' Inva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders of the Iſland of <hi>Rhé</hi> were ſtruck with the Spirit of Confuſion from the beginning of th'Enterprize; A fatal Blindneſs, which did not abandon them from the time it had ceized them, till they were loſt, and had made Abortive one of the boldeſt and beſt laid Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects, which of a long time hath been contrived; And it hapned unto it, as to thoſe formidable Engines, ſometimes ſeen in War, which a little thing renders uſeleſs and unprofitable, at th'Inſtant that they begin to break.</p>
                  <p>In the ſecond place, I ſay, That it muſt be laid for Foundation and Maxim; That Subjects may of themſelves riſe againſt their So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veraign, and break the Bonds of Obedience which they owe him, by the ſole ſtrength of their Paſſions. But that this Riſing can main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain it ſelf in heat, if it be not heated from abroad; Or this new Liberty long Lived, if ſome Forein Power did not nouriſh it, Is that which hath been ſeldom ſeen, and there be but a few Examples of it, But there are a great number which teſtifie, that th'One can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be without th'other; And that a Revolt is Ill ſeated, that hath for Foundation but the Forces of a Rebellious People. I will alſo make uſe, to confirm this Truth, of th'Example of the <hi>Suiſſes,</hi> and of that of the <hi>Flemings,</hi> becauſe I have already made mention of them. There's no Queſtion, but that after th'Inhabitanes of that ſalvage and rule Country, to which the Village of <hi>Suits</hi> hath given the name, had taken Arms againſt the Princes of <hi>Auſtria,</hi> and to deliver themſelves from that Long Violence, and Inſupportable Tyranny, which they exerciſed over them by their Governours, and that they were delivered from the Domination of their bad Maſters; But that the Republique remained a long time Trembling, and ill Aſſured; That it did not begin to ſettle and draw a free Air, but under the protection of <hi>Charls</hi> the Seventh, and received not its en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tire Conſiſtency, and its perfect Eſtabliſhment, but from the Alli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance it made with <hi>Lewis</hi> the Eleventh. When the <hi>Flemings</hi> had re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolved to ſhake off the yoke of <hi>Spain,</hi> and t'adore no longer an ill manag'd Power, though it was Lawful; They had not held out long, if Neighbour Powers had not intereſſed themſelves in their Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſts, and if ſeveral Reliefs had not been drawn unto them from <hi>Germany, France,</hi> and <hi>England.</hi> I add to what hath been above-ſaid, That, when in the time of our Fathers, Hereſie and Ambition united againſt Soveraign Power, and that from theſe Two Springs of Rebellion, a Party did ariſe, which left to our Kings but a part of their Authority, and to this Kingdom but a part of their Forces; Though this Party was animated by them of the Blood of our Kings, and guided by one of th' ableſt Commanders of his time; <note place="margin">Prince of <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dé</hi> and <hi>Chaſtil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lon</hi> Admiral of <hi>France.</hi>

                     </gap>f Forein Forces had not ſupported them, and if it had not been often relieved by <hi>Engliſh</hi> Gold, and <hi>German</hi> Forces. For the Decay and Ruine of that Party was dated effectively from the drineſs of the Springs, which had furniſhed it with powerful Contributions, and that the Veins which had brought it Blood and Life, were obſtructed, and no longer open; When <hi>Germany</hi> fell into an Inability, and <hi>England</hi> became Fearful or Weak, and <hi>Spain</hi> Slow or Irreſolute to relieve it. Thence it ariſeth, That the People who ſtudy Changes, and diſpoſe themſelves for bold and violent Reſolutions, never undertake them but upon ſome Forein Inſpiration, accompanied with promiſes of great Reliefs, or in ſuch a Conjuncture of Time and Affairs, as makes out unto them ſome Haven which may put them in ſafety, and ſecure them in time of Tempeſt. But to ſpeak of preſent things, and of the Riſing of the <hi>Catalans,</hi> There's no queſtion, but that th' had never undertaken it, what pretence ſoever they had, which is not here to be examined, but by favour of their preſent Conjuncture; And though it was contrived long before, and the whole matter pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pared, whereof it was then formed, yet it had not iſſued from the Womb of its Cauſes, not taken Light, if th'Arms of <hi>France</hi> had not been Triumphant in all places; If thoſe of <hi>Spain</hi> had not been unfortunate in <hi>Flanders,</hi> and in <hi>Italy,</hi> and if the Reputation of th' Imperialiſts had not been abated in <hi>Germany.</hi> In the third place, I ſay, That in the Matter of the People's Emotions, nothing of cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainty can be promiſed, nor of Knowledge of the Duration, till they have treated with the Prince from whom they Implored Aid, and have given him Pledges of their Faith to content; And that there's no greater or ſurer Pledge, than in giving up themſelves; Till then, he may have cauſe to doubt, that the ſhew he ſhall make to protect them, will ſerve onely to raiſe Jealouſie in the Prince, whoſe Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects they are, and provoke him the more to Turn all manner of Wheels, and Employ all poſſible Inventions, to reduce them to their Duty, and to diſolve th'Union that is not well aſſured; Till then, I ſay, he will have juſt cauſe to diſtruſt an Accommodation with their Prince; And leſt, ſhaken betwixt th' Apprehenſions of the Troubles and Miſeries that attend the Victory, if it ſhould re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>main to their Prince, and th'offers not onely of Impunity, but alſo of Recompence, wherewith h'endeavours to blind them, They take th' occaſion to return to his favour; It being the nature of the Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple to change readily their paſſion; As to return willingly to a more peaceable condition, and to a gentler ſtate than theirs may appear to them in their Revolt. That being ſo, there would not be leſs fear of
<pb n="103" facs="tcp:33686:56"/>Evil in their Accommodation, than hopes of Good in their Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>order; Their Repentance might prove as fatal to him, as their Sin favourable, and they would b' obliged to purge at his Charges the fault they had committed, for the not finiſhing of it, and to turn againſt him the Forces they had prepared againſt their Prince.</p>
                  <p>That if they reſolve, not t'undertake by Halfs, what otherwiſe they ought not t'have Begun; If they reſiſt th'Offers and the Threat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nings of their firſt Prince, and take them, as it may be they are, for the Snares he lays, and for th'Ambuſhes he ſets for them; If they perſwade themſelves, That he will not believe himſelf bound to keep that to them, which he had promiſed with all Ill-will, and they had Forced from him; nor t'obſerve the Faith h'had given them, ſince that, he may ſay, he would not break it, but for their good, and t'hinder them another time to become Rebells: But if they peſevere in the deſire of ſhaking off the Yoke, wherewith they may believe themſelves in time oppreſſed, and t'implore th'Aid and Protection of another Prince, There are ſome Conſiderations to be had before He conſents to their Relief.</p>
                  <p>At firſt ſight, It ſeems to be a thing of an ill ſavour, and of a dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerous Example amongſt Princes, That a Prince ſhould oblige him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf by Treaty to defend and protect another Princes Subjects in Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bellion; That 'tis to wound a Right wherein all Sovereigns are in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſſed in the Conſequence, and give Heart to Rebellion to b' in all places more buſie and bold than it would be, if it did believe it ſelf deſtitute of Forein Aid, and of Auxiliary Forces. 'Tis not truly to be denied, but that generally taken, 'tis ſo; And it happens not often, that Princes declare themſelves publickly in favour of the Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects of other Princes, nor that they relieve them openly and with flying Colours; When they do it, 'tis ordinarily done without noiſe, and as it were in private; 'Tis like hiding th'Arm after the Stone is thrown; 'Tis either in furniſhing of Money ſecretly, as <hi>Philip</hi> the Second did to the Chiefs of the League during the life of <hi>Henry</hi> the Third; or in Licenſing of Troops, and permitting them to paſs to the Rebel Party, as the <hi>Venetians</hi> did in the War of the Barons of <hi>Naples</hi> againſt th'old <hi>Ferdinand</hi> and the Duke of <hi>Calabria</hi> his ſon, as it hath been obſerved in another place.</p>
                  <p>In this, a Diſtinction is to b' uſed, which will clear this Doubt, and reconcile what may ſeem to b'oppoſite and contrary; 'Tis, that nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther the Law of Conſcience, nor that of Civil Prudence doth permit, That in time of Peace and Calmneſs, and at leaſt, when there's no cauſe of Revenge, or to divert a Storm that threatens, that Troubles ſhould be ſtirred up in the Neighbouring States, nor that Subjects b' invited to take up Arms againſt their Prince; But when War is kindled betwixt two Princes, and that they burn with a Reciprocal heat to do their worſt, and to deſtroy one another, The Difficulty is abated, and there's more reaſon to ask, Whether one of the Princes may with a good Conſcience cheriſh the Rebellion of another
<pb n="104" facs="tcp:33686:57"/>Princes Subjects? Or to repeat the ſame things in various Forms, or to rehabit the ſame Idaea and the ſame ſenſe with different Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſions, Whether a Prince with a good Conſcience may Joyn his Forces with Rebel-Forces, and Act joyntly, and by way of Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervation with them againſt an Enemy whom he may with a good Conſcience fight without their aid? Or if it be permited him to di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miniſh the number of his Enemies, in giving Heat to perſons, who will be of Neceſſity Againſt him, if they are not For him, and will become His Enemies if He holds them not in good humour and Power to remain His Friends? or elſe, if that be leſs allowed him, than to receive Officers and Soldiers from the contrary Party which come to Joyn with his Army; Than to make uſe againſt his Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies of Horſes, of Canon, and of other Inſtruments of War, He ſhall gain from them? And in general, Whether H' have the ſame right t'uſe th'Enemies Arms which Fortune preſents unto him, and cauſeth to fall int' his hands without Labour, As thoſe which he gains with his Arms, which by force He makes His, and are of Law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful Conqueſt, and fruits of a Juſts War.</p>
                  <p>But 'tis certain, That theſe things move upon the ſame foot, and equal force; And that if th'one are permitted, whereof there's no Queſtion, There's no difficulty nor ſcruple for th'others. At the worſt, there's no doubt, but that his proceeding is gentler and leſs odious, than to corrupt the fidelity of the Governour of a place, which is every day practiſed by the moſt Religious Princes, who make no conſcience t'endeavour the taking of that by Good-will, which they believe is permitted unto them to take by force; And to buy with a little Mony that, which would coſt the Blood and Lives of a great Number of their Subjects. In this, a very notable difference may be ſeen, for in the firſt Caſe, whereof there hath been diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe, Princes are ſollicited, Protection demanded, their Aid im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plored againſt Violence and Tyranny; They give onely Aliment to what hath already Life, and make profit of th'Evil, if there be any, which others have committed, and make uſe of the Benefit which Fortune offers them. But in the ſecond Caſe, they ſeek, they draw, they deboſh, they do in ſome ſort give birth t'Infidelity and Treaſon; And nevertheleſs they believe, that 'tis permitted them in good Conſcience, and they practiſe it whithout ſcruple, and with glory. 'Tis true, that the Juſtice which Soveraigns exerciſe againſt So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veraigns hath a long extent, and its bounds are enlarged beyond the diſtributions made to Particular Perſons; That the Right of War, which is a Right of Force and Subtilty, is maintained by ſtrange Means, and with Addreſſes forbidden to the Right of Private Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons, and that the ſafety of the People is in the Souls of Princes, a Law predominant t'all other Laws, and th'obligation they have to procure it, is ſuperior to th'other Obligations of their Charge. From hence it may appear, That the King in receiving the <hi>Catalans,</hi> who did caſt themſelves int' his Arms, hath not committed ſo great a
<pb n="105" facs="tcp:33686:57"/>Crime, as ignorant, and Paſſionate perſons for <hi>Spain</hi> have publiſhed it; That therein he hath done nothing, that was of ill Example, but what he might Lawfully have done, which the Law of Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience hath appointed, and that of Prudence adviſed. And ſince that in the midſt of Peace, which the <hi>Spaniards</hi> had with us, They made no difficulty openly to favour, and in the ſight of all the world, the Rebels of <hi>France;</hi> And that before any breach, they treated with the Duke of <hi>Rohan,</hi> whilſt he was Head of a Party; and made uſe of the diſcontentment of one of our Pritces, and ſent with him into this Kingdom ſome Troops of caſual <hi>Polaques;</hi> who live onely of Prey, and whoſe Valour conſiſts not in the Taking of Places, that Reſiſt, but in Burning them, which cannot Defend themſelves; nor in gaining of Battels, but in Killing after the Victory. Since that the Right of Revenge belongs to Princes, and that 'tis Lawful for them to render, what hath been lent them; I do not think, that in the Terms we were with the <hi>Spaniards,</hi> and in th' Heat of the War had with them, the King ought to make difficulty of granting to the <hi>Catalans</hi> the Protection they deſired of him, or to receive them, who gave themſelves up voluntarily, ſince it was lawful for him to take them by force, and t'have made himſelf Maſter of them by His Armies.</p>

We muſt now treat of an Inevitable Inconveniency in this Matter, and of a more difficult Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolution, To wit, wherein this Protection ſhall Terminate, and what the Prince who gives it ſhall do'n their favour, in caſe Peace be made; How at laſt it muſt be made, that Reſt may ſucceed Trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, and a Calm t' a Tempeſt: For Rebel-Subjects muſt return to their Natural Princes grace by means of a Treaty, and be reconciled unt'him by the Mediation of th'other Prince their Protector, or muſt be freed from his Domination, and make a State apart, and a ſepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rated Body, As the <hi>Suiſſes</hi> have done, and as th'<hi>Hollanders</hi> do; or that they hold of him, wh' hath delivered them from ſervitude, and as the ſecond Maſter, whom they make choice of to get out of th'others Yoke; or that they b'abandoned and left, as a Prey, to the Diſpleaſure and Anger of their Prince.</p>

                  <p> As to the Firſt Point, (the ſame Judgement may be made, and in ſtronger Terms of the Second and Third) It muſt be a very difficult thing for a Soverain to digeſt, That another ſould take that Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage over him, as to be the Mediator and Arbiter betwixt him and his Subjects, and Fortune muſt put him int'a low Station, and offer him a ſtrange Violence, to make him accept of ſuch hard Conditions, and ſuch diſhonorable Terms. In the Treaty of <hi>Madrill,</hi> and that of <hi>Cambray,</hi> which was, to ſpeak properly, but the Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rective and Moderation of th other, ſome particular <hi>French</hi> Perſons indeed, who followed the <hi>Spaniſh</hi> Party, were reſtored to their Honours and Goods by thoſe Treaties. But who knows not in what Conſtitution <hi>France</hi> was at that time? Who knows not that th'Heavens had none but malignant Aſpects and froward Influences for it? And that Fortune pouring out her Favours upon <hi>Spain,</hi> had forgot ſhe was Changeable. It hath been ſeen, what a hard Labour it was ſome years paſt t'obtain Pardon for the Marquis of <hi>St. George,</hi> and for ſome other <hi>Montferrans,</hi> who ſerved the Duke of <hi>Savoy</hi> in the VVars He had ſince the death of the late King, with the Dukes of <hi>Mantoua.</hi> The difficulty the <hi>Genoueſe</hi> Expreſſed, and the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſtance they made againſt pardoning the Priſoners, hath been ſeen, whom th' Accuſed t' have Conſpired againſt their Country with the Duke of <hi>Savoy,</hi> to give him Entry into <hi>Genes;</hi> And that at laſt in th' Accommodation the Republique made with the Duke, a Means was Invented, and a Temper found t'hinder theſe Criminals of the State to periſh; And that it might not appear, that the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>publique had given them grace. And in the Treaty of <hi>Vervins,</hi> the Deputies of the late King oppoſed vigorouſly the Comprehenſion of any <hi>French-man,</hi> that had taken part with the <hi>Spaniard,</hi> and to deny any favour to th'Interceſſion of Strangers, of what belonged to the Clemency of a Prince.</p>
                  <p>Moreover, it was not without a great grief of heart, and a great Repugnancy, that the <hi>Spaniards</hi> permitted th'Embaſſadors of <hi>France, England,</hi> and <hi>Venice,</hi> not onely to ſign, as Moderators, but alſo as Sureties on their Maſters behalf, the Treaty of <hi>Verceil,</hi> which de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termined the War raiſed from the not Execution of that of <hi>Aſt;</hi> And nevertheleſs, the Queſtion was not herein, of a difference be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt Subject and Soveraign, and of thoſe Quarrels of State, which are not Appeaſed, but by the Submiſſion or Puniſhment of th'One, and by th' Indulgency or Juſtice of th'Other. The Queſtion was onely of a Punctilio of Honour, and of a Preheminence of Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity, which the <hi>Spaniards</hi> affected, to Treat in all <hi>Italy</hi> as Maſters; T'<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

It angred much thoſe ambitious Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons, That a Duke of <hi>Savoy</hi> had the boldneſs t' oppoſe that publick Neceſſity, and to reſiſt the common Deſtiny of the petty Princes of
<pb n="107" facs="tcp:33686:58"/>
                     <hi>Italy.</hi> They could not endure his Thoughts of a Free Pince, nor that he ſhould uſe the Privileges of Soveraignty, and Act th' In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dependent near them. It was the cauſe of the Troubles they raiſed upon him, and renewed two or three Times. This obliged <hi>France</hi> not permit him t' yield under ſo juſt a Cauſe; This made <hi>France</hi> with <hi>England,</hi> and the Republick of <hi>Venice,</hi> t' undertake the Warrantry of what was Accorded to the Duke by the <hi>Spaniards;</hi> and this was the cauſe of bitterneſs and grief to them, to be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrained, for th' Avoiding of worſe, and to draw upon them, with the War, Strangers int' <hi>Italy;</hi> following the Maxim they then held, and which they ought never t' abandon; To be compelled, I ſay, after th' Offer of all imaginable Advantages to the Duke, and ſearch of all poſſible Expedients, to divert the Mediation of the forementioned Ambaſſadors, to conſent, That they ſhould be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come Pledges of th' Obſervation of the Treaty. That if we've ſeen happen ſomewhat like it between the King and his Rebel-Subjects; And if <hi>England</hi> mingled with their Affairs, and Interpoſed in the Treaty which was given them before <hi>Montpellier;</hi> 'Tis to be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidered, that 'twas permitted by that hard and Inexorable Law, which makes the Leſſer Evil to b' Accepted t' avoid the Greater; and that in reſpect of the Wearineſs which oppreſſed <hi>France,</hi> It was adjudged to be more Expedient to procure its Reſt with a Little ſhame, than to Leave it in the Trouble of War, with an Extreme peril; Or truly it muſt b' avowed, That there was not Vigour and Courage enough in the Councel, or Care enough of the King's Honor, and of the Dignity of the Crown, and that the veins of them, who Governed in that Time, were not filled with thoſe Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerous Spirits, and that Magnanimous Blood whereof ſo great Effects are ſeen in the preſent Adminiſtration. And to ſpeak the Truth, theſe forced Peaces, and theſe violent Reconciliations are not of Long Duration; They muſt quickly break, from what ſide ſoever the fault comes; And the Subjects proud and fierce upon this Forein Protection, cannot contain themſelves within their Bounds, which are marked out unto them, or the Prince cannot permit his Subjects t'have relation t'any other Soveraignty than his, whereby ſhadow only of Authority remains t' him, and from which he receives onely an Apparence of Affection, whilſt they give th' Heart and Reality t' another Prince.</p>
                  <p>What followed the Peace of <hi>Montpellier</hi> hath given us occaſion to verifie this Truth, and ſhew, that it being made of neceſſity, or for fear, and Forced rather than freely Accorded; That th'Intervention and Warrant of th' <hi>Engliſh</hi> was of uſe to give the greater Jealouſie to the King againſt them, wh'had made Addreſſes t' <hi>England,</hi> to give him a greater curioſity in th' obſervance of their Deportments, and a greater Inclination t' interpret them with a ſpirit of diſtruſt; That they ſerved onely to make them the more Tender and Senſible
<pb n="108" facs="tcp:33686:59"/>of the leaſt ſcratch, they Imagin'd to be given to the Peace; to make them the more bold in demanding of Reparation, and to demand it with Threatnings; T' Encourage them to proceed rather as Equals than Subjects in all theſe Troubles; From what cauſe it proceeded this is not the time t' enquire after, and that I've deſign'd it for another place. At laſt, all things conſpired t' an open breach, as hath been obſerved, and from all thoſe Collective Cauſes, was formed the moſt dangerous War that threatned the State, ſince the birth of Hereſie. Nevertheleſs, God Converted into Good thoſe ſad Apparences, and hindred th' Evil t' Accompliſh its period; He ſtopt it in the ſtrength of its Motion, and in the midſt of its Courſe; And raiſed to the King Miniſters of State, who would not ſtrip him of his Virtue by their Coldneſs, but give him an Edge by their Courage; not to go awry at the ſight of the Diſor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders, and to cut off ſome Branches; but t' Aſſault it in a ſtrait Line, and to cut it up by the Roots; Not t' Allay for ſome time the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bellion with Promiſes, which they knew would not be kept, and may be believed ought not to be kept; but to put it in a Condition to Capi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tulate no more with his Maſter, and to take from it for the future, the Will to riſe, in taking from it the Power of Riſing. And that fell out happily, for th' <hi>Engliſh</hi> were beaten, and th' <hi>Hugonots</hi> humbled in that War; <hi>Rochel</hi> fell to the ground, and <hi>Spain</hi> became Blind or Lazre in not furniſhing the Relief it had promiſed to the Dying party.</p>
                  <p>Somewhat like to this laſt Circumſtance hath been ſeen in the Peace which the late Emperor made a little before at <hi>Lubec</hi> with the King of <hi>Denmark.</hi> The Princes whoſe Protection h'had underta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken were admitted only under the General Clauſe, which was a Mark of Dereliction, <hi>That th'Emperor ſhould not diſturb any Perſon againſt Juſtice and Equity: That during ſuch time the King of</hi> Denmark <hi>ſhould not Engage in th' Affairs of th' Empire, And that he ſhould no more Inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe in th' Affairs of</hi> Germany, <hi>th<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

In the King of <hi>Denmarks</hi> Condition, His Declining the Protection of his Allies was no more, than to Part with that which was not in his power to Maintain, and to Quit that he could no longer hold, and to Renounce that which produced no real Thing to th'Emperor, <note place="margin">In the Month of <hi>June,</hi> 1629.</note> and was but an unprofitable mark of Superiority, which Victory had made very viſible. He did receive ſolid Benefits, redeemed all his Loſſes, and allayed the Tempeſt that was ready to break upon the Reſt of his States. But th' Ambition of the <hi>Spaniards,</hi> and the preſſure th'uſed to th'Emperor to ſend his Armies into <hi>Italy,</hi> againſt a Catholick Prince, wh' had done him no hurt, compelled him to make e Peace, as hath elſe-where been obſerved,
<pb n="109" facs="tcp:33686:59"/>with a Proteſtant Prince that had offended him; To cool his good Fortune in its greateſt heat, and to reſtrain the Current of the Victo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, which might have paſſed the Bounds of the <hi>Baltique</hi> Sea; And t' have ſtopped that fatal Power which hath ſince Over-run th' Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pire, and ſhaken the very Foundations of th' Houſe of <hi>Austria.</hi> How<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever, 'tis a proof of great Superiority in Power, or of a great height in Succeſs, t' Exclude out of Treaties of Peace, or to Comprehend in them, whom they will. And Intereſts of State muſt be very Violent, which oblige Princes to forget their Friends in their Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>commodations, whoſe Faithfulneſs they've made Trial of in the Quarrel. In ſuch a Dereliction, they cannot ſave their Honour, but by th' Extreme Neceſſity of their Affairs, nor be diſpenſed from th' obſervation of their Faith, but by that Supreme Law, which ought to regulate their Conduct in the ſafety of their Subjects. Whereupon they that would Excuſe them, may ſay; That 'tis a Condition which Enters privately int' all their Alliances, and a Reſerve which needs not be Compriſed, becauſe it cannot b' Excluded, and which Equal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly concerns th'Intereſt of all the Confederates; And there's none but makes uſe of it in caſe of Neceſſity, or that believes himſelf obliged to periſh, if he cannot be ſecure in Company; There's none that believes himſelf forſworn, when h' holds not that, which he believes never t'have promiſed. And though in the Treaties of Confederations all do promiſe, not to make Agreement without the Knowledge and Conſent of one another; All underſtand it, nevertheleſs; with that Exception, But it the caſe of an Extreme ill Fortune, which allows n' other Security; or from an utter Ruine, that admits of no Safety, but by ſuch a Breach; That if this were not ſo, it were t'act againſt th'End of Confederates, wherein many d'Engage and Unite them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, to reſiſt together an Evil, which would be Superiour to the Forces of each particular perſon, but none of them would ſhut up himſelf, if it were not Lawful for him to go out, when he ſhall not find ſafety there, and ſhould be Loſt in a Longer ſtay; That they're like Ships, where they that guide them, oblige themſelves to work all they Can to defend them againſt a Storm, but where every perſon re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerves t' himſelf the Liberty to provide for his ſafety in forſaking of them, when they're ready to ſtrike ground, and that the Wrack is Inevitable. That Countries are in th'hands of Princes, as the goods of Minors; They're the Guardians, but not in all Senſes the Maſters of them; And in the whole humane Society there's no Depoſite ſo Sacred and ſo Inviolable as that is to them. The people from whom they hold it, have committed it unto them indeed, but have not ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolutely given it unto <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>hem, and without a Condition. They've indeed given them the Tuition, but have not given them the Power of Alienation, or to put them in Danger of Periſhing, and of chang<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Maſter.</p>
                  <p>To what hath been already ſaid, may alſo b'added, That' tis better
<pb n="110" facs="tcp:33686:60"/>that one of the Confederates giving way to Time, and ſtriking Sail before Fortune, make his Peace alone, the better t' Endeavour th'Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>provement of th' others Conditions, and to ſerve them for Relief, than that they ſhould Loſe themſelves by the pretence of a falſe Courage, and by a Delicacy of humour, which may indeed be per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted in the Conduct of Particular perſons, but ought never to b' ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted into that of Princes, nor find place in their Affairs. That, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides this, theres no doubt, but that 'tis a moſt baſe diſhonour for them to fail in th' obſervation of promiſes; And that no Greatneſs can be gained, or Eſtabliſhment made, that can repair the breaches of violated Faith, and purge the ſhame of Perjury.</p>
                  <p>Theſe are Conſiderations, which have entred into my Underſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding, to diſcharge as much as may be, the proceedings which Princes ſometimes are Conſtrained t' uſe in the matter of Treaties. I do not pretend, nevertheleſs, to warrant my thoughts from Infallibility, or to make them paſs for Deciſions and Dogmatiques. I leave t' every perſon the Liberty of Judgment, according t' his Senſe to Condemn or Approve them, as it ſhall ſeem good t' him, and to take them for ſound Reaſons, and for Addreſſes of good Direction; or onely for Colours, which paint, or for Ways that occaſion Wandrings. How<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever, great care muſt be taken not t' Exerciſe and Practiſe ſo tickliſh a Conduct every day; And no other uſe is to be made of them, than as of Poiſons in Medicines, That's to ſay, ſparingly, and againſt Extreme Evils, and with Excellent Correctives, and Exquiſite Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parations. I add alſo, that in th' Example, which I have alleged of <hi>Demark,</hi> I do not underſtand Fundamentally to condemn the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duct of that Prince, nor to Conſtitute my ſelf Judge Soveraign of a thing whereof I do not know all th' occult Reaſons by which that Nation might have cauſe to get out, which ought to be preſumed to be Juſt, nor all th' hidden Wheels that gave it Motion, which might have rendred it neceſſary; I've onely drawn th'Exterior, and what hath appeared without, and hath not a plauſible ſhew, which I've endeavoured to Temper &amp; Sweeten by my Lenitive Conſiderations. Not touching then upon what may b' of Truth in the Foundation of ſuch proceedings, what appeared without, ſeems to b' an Argument of Infidelity or Weakneſs, and both of thoſe Qualities are Precipices, wherein a Prince will never fall if he be Virtuous, and will ſeldom fall into th'other, if he b' of good foreſight, and knows well how to take his Meaſures. From whence I conclude, That the laſt may not happen, And that the Prince who protects, be not compelled to give the World ſo ſhameful an Evidence of his Weakneſs, That either h' ought at firſt Inſtance to Reject the propoſals of the people, who Implore his Protection, and ſhut the Door t' all Importunities; or if he receive them, t' Act Vigorouſly with ſo Conſiderable Forces, that apparently Nothing ought to deprive him of the Victory; nor hinder by conſequence the Peace to be made upon his own Tearms, and Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cure
<pb n="111" facs="tcp:33686:60"/>the People, whoſe defence h'had undertaken, and with whoſe ſafety h'had charged himſelf. A worthier Example to follow cannot be preſented, nor a more excellent Model for Imitation in like Oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>currences, than the Conduct the King obſerved in the Buſineſs of <hi>Catalognia.</hi> So ſoon as it appeared, and that ſo great an Occaſion t'advance our affairs ſhewed it ſelf, He wiſely judged, That there was no reaſon to permit it t'eſcape; That there was no Cauſe for Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſting the good Fortune, which came to ſeek us without a Call, not to refuſe a Favour, which th'Heavens offered us ſo freely. And as 'tis ſeen ſometimes in difficult Maladies, that Nature makes ſome Demonſtration, which declares to the Phyſicians the way th' ought to take to cure the ſick Perſons, and diſcovers to them the place by which the diſeaſe is to b'aſſaulted; The King alſo very well under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtood, That by this unlook'd for Accident, and by this unhop'd for Chance, of the riſing of the <hi>Catelans,</hi> God marked out unt'us one of the ways w'ought to take, t'arrive at th'Haven we went to Sea for, and t'attain that End for which w'undertook the War; A ſure and honeſt Peace, a firm and laſting Reſt to Chriſtian Princes.</p>
                  <p>He underſtook, That if h'had reaſon t'undertake the War in that Country, when all <hi>Spain</hi> oppoſed it, and that all the People joyned with the Prince to ruine our Deſigns, and to make our Arms fruit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs; The ſame Cauſes and Reaſons being on foot, The beſt Peopled, and the moſt Warlick Province of that Nation being ſever'd from th'other Provinces, and Joyned with our Forces; There was no pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bability, but that we might promiſe to our ſelves a good ſucceſs of that buſineſs; H' ought indeed ſo to believe it, and believe alſo, That if that affair was happily Embarqu'd, and that the favour of Heaven did not abandon the progreſs of it, That the proſperity would not be confined to the Frontiers of <hi>Catalognia,</hi> That its good Influence might extend its ſelf further; And as a Needle rubbed with the Load<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtone hath the virtue to draw others, That the ſubſiſtence of the <hi>Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>talans</hi> might be th'Attractive to draw th'other diſcontented Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinces after it. He knew that the <hi>Portugueſe</hi> were full of good will to riſe, ſince the time of their ſubmiſſion to the Crown of <hi>Spain;</hi> That they could not bear any Yoke with more Impatience; That they always breathed after their antient form of Government, and that th'hatred they had for the <hi>Caſtillians</hi> was ſo natural and ſtrong, that no length of Time, nor moderation of Conduct, could efface th'Impreſſion, and allay the Violence. He judg'd, that th' <hi>Arragons,</hi> wh' have not yet loſt the Remembrance of <hi>Philip</hi> the Second's uſage, wh' are outragious with ſpite for the breach of their Privileges, and loſs of their Liberty; Who know that of Right it belongs t' Us, would obſerve what the firſt Succeſſes of their Neighbours Arms would be; What form of their Eſtabliſhment, and what the ſignes and preſages of their future duration, to Joyn themſelves, it may be with us, if they might do 't with ſafety, and if they ſaw in that Union Reſiſtance and Force enough againſt th' Enterpriſes of their
<pb n="112" facs="tcp:33686:61"/>common Enemy. H' alſo judged, That if that War could be drawn out into length, and that the firſt Effort of the Troops the <hi>Spaniſh</hi> King ſhould draw together to reduce or confound the <hi>Catalans,</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore they were in a condition to Reſiſt him, failed of its effect; It was of Neceſſity for him to recall from the <hi>Low-countries,</hi> or from <hi>Italy,</hi> ſome part of his Forces t'oppoſe them which were drawn out againſt him in the midſt of his Country, and as in the Centre of his Monarchy. And by Conſequent, that his other States remaining naked and weak, they would b'expoſed to very dangerous ſtrokes, and to very great wounds; And that many other good Effects and happy Encounters might derive themſelves from that Cauſe and Spring. And therefore the Kings proceeding upon th'Occurrence of <hi>Catalognia,</hi> could not be more Judicious, nor the motion of his Arms better adjuſted to the Laws of Civil Prudence.</p>

                  <p>WHat I have ſaid of the King's Proceedings upon the Inſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rections of <hi>Catalognia,</hi> carries me t'another Conſideration, which is not of ſmall weight for the managing of a War made in ſeveral places, and divides it ſelf into many Branches at diſtance with one another; 'Tis, that in this Action, the ſupreme degree of Mili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tary Wiſdom, and as it were the precious Elixar to render any War happy, Is, t'Endeavour induſtriouſly to know the place, which ought to be the principal Siege, and to turn on that ſide the chief of their Forces; As to b' always ready to change Conduct, as cauſe ſhall be given, and the War to take another Conduct, and another Form in order to that End.

There the ſecond Examination of the Buſineſs is made, and th'advices and Reaſons of the firſt Councels are put again to the Trial and Re-examination.</p>
                  <p>And, as in th'Oeconomy of th'Human Body, the Spirits which are formed in the Liver, paſs to th'Heart to be purifi'd, and there to diſcharge themſelves of the groſſer part, and from thence ariſe to the Brain, where they receive th' ultimate degree of ſubtilty and light, whereof they are capable, and ſuch a temper as renders them the neareſt Organs of the Motion of the Body, and of th'Operation of the Senſes; In like manner, the Reſolutions of this ſecond Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cel are carried to a Third, which is the Councel of State of the Prince, to receive there a Third Examination, and to ſee, if they may find a place in th'order of his affairs; And if that which is conformable to the good of th'affairs of <hi>Italy,</hi> whereunto the two firſt Councels have onely their Aſpect, be not contrary to the general good of their Monarchy. They Act not onely in this Order, and with ſo great a Refinement of Prudence in their own Affairs, and which immediately concern them, but they bring alſo the ſame Cares, and the ſame conteſt of Spirit, t' Examine th' Affairs of th' Houſe of <hi>Austria</hi> in <hi>Germany;</hi> and to direct the Form and Motion that ought to guide them; Nevertheleſs, with this difference, That although they addreſs, as to their Centre, the Particulars which they have collected, as to the general Good of their Houſe; They ſo order it, That the general Good remains always inferiour and ſubaltern to the particular Intereſts of their Houſe, and to the great Deſign they've had to greaten it without Meaſure, and to raiſe it to th' Univerſal Chriſtian Monarchy. I've already brought ſome Examples for the proof of this Truth, and I could bring others above number to confirm it, if there were need, and if it were not ſo evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent and known, that it would ſeem to give light to the Sun, and to
<pb n="114" facs="tcp:33686:62"/>make his Light viſible; So that you muſt not b' Amazed, if the Councel of <hi>Vienna</hi> is but th'Inſtrument of the Reſolutions, whereof the Councel of <hi>Madril</hi> is th'Author; And if you ſee nothing come from that, which bears not the mark of th'other, and receiv'd th'Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſions of their Maxims and Conduct.</p>
                  <p>And ſince the knowledge of facts, and of the true ſtate of things, is the Baſis of Reaſonings, and that theſe have no ſubſiſtence, if th'others b'ill grounded; And reſemble the Colours of the Bowe in Heaven, that are falſe, though they are full of brightneſs and come<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lineſs, for want of a Body, wherein they might b' infuſed and faſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned; They provide againſt this Inconveniency two way; Th'one is, by an unlimited Power they give to their Agents to diſtribute Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neys, and not to conſider any ſort of Expence to be well informed of what paſſeth; As to penetrate what is deliberated and reſolved at the Reſults of their Enemies and Friends; And that Expence is fully allowed them without Examination or Reſtriction, and upon the ſingle Account which they preſent. Their Reaſon is, that although this be Matter for Deceit and for Avarice to make unjuſt Harveſts; They'd rather run th'hazard, as Inconſiderable, for the good which may ariſe to them, as very great; And they believe, That an Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pence well imploy'd in that behalf, and a good advice given to pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe, make them Recompence with Intereſt for a hundred loſt Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pences, and for a hundred unprofitable Advices. Th' other way is, That no People of the world were ever more careful t'entertain their Correſpondencies, or a greater Number of them; They do not af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect onely ſpecious ones, and with illuſtrious Perſons, but they alſo form Correſpondencies with all them that will b'obliged with them; And Experience hath taught them, that a Perſon of a Low Condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and of little ſenſe, may diſcover to them ſometimes an im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portant Truth, which might have paſt by the Cares and Subtilty of great Perſonages.

After then that they've un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtood the preſent ſtate of their Affairs, and obſerved the place where it imports them moſt t'Act, They turn on that ſide, as hath been ſaid, the chief of their Forces, t' Act the more ſafely, and to break and overcome by an exceſs of Power all that may oppoſe it,
<pb n="115" facs="tcp:33686:62"/>and give Reſiſtance; They reſolve to permit ſmall Loſſes, and light Diſadvantages in one place, t'obtain great Succeſſes in another; and they well know, that the Branches cannot remain ſafe, when the Body of the Tr<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>e is cut down, and that after the wounding of the Nobler parts, th'others Die of themſelves. 'Tis by this Principle, that we've ſometimes ſeen our Frontiers covered with fearfull Clowds of their Men of War, which have been nevertheleſs diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perſed, and that the Lower <hi>Germany</hi> hath ſeen formed againſt it great and formidable Bodies of Imperial Armies, which have alſo been defeated.</p>
                  <p>Since w' are in the way to ſpeak of the Conduct, which the Princes of th' Houſe of <hi>Austria</hi> have accuſtomed particularly t' ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve in the War, it may not be amiſs to remark alſo here, That when they reſolve upon any great Deſign, and that they prepare for ſome High Enterprize, Th' act it with the moſt Privacy, and with the leaſt poſſible Noiſe; Th' uſe their greateſt care, that it take no Air, as if they wrought in a Mine; They make ſhew of Reſt and Sleep, when they Labour moſt, and are moſt Awake; They're not angry when they're accuſed of Impuiſſancy, and they ſcatter of themſelves Colourable Reaſons, and furniſh Specious Colours to make that Accuſation probable. 'Tis not hard to divine th'End of that Artifice, which is to lay aſleep and to ſurprize: And Hiſtory and Experience do ſufficiently inſtruct us, what incredible Advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tages they do ſometimes draw thereby to themſelves, and what great and prodigious ſtroaks they make by the force of that Artifice, and by the favour of that Silence. Th'ill ſucceſs of the Battel of St. <hi>Quin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tin</hi> had its beginning in thoſe ſecret and hidden Preparations, which <hi>Philip</hi> the Second made of the great Forces wherewith he did enter <hi>Picardy;</hi> And in that fatal Credulity that poſſeſſed us of his Weak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, and of the ſmall Means h'had t' Arm powerfully, till we learned it at our Charges, and were beaten with the Thunder, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore w' had any ſight of the Lightning: W' have not loſt the me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mory of a thing ſo freſh and ſenſible as the ſurprize, which had al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt oppreſſed <hi>Banier</hi> in th'High <hi>Palatinate,</hi> and the Storm that broke ſ' unexpectedly upon him, that it failed but little, but that the whole Power of the <hi>Swedes</hi> in <hi>Germany</hi> had with that ſtroke been over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thrown with the <hi>German</hi> Liberty.</p>
                  <p>I add alſo, that when th'Heavens ſecond their Providence, and becomes propitious to their Deſigns, there's not a People in the world, to ſpeak ordinarily, wh' underſtand better to make good uſe of her favours, and to ſerve themſelves of their Advantages; Whereas others do become remiſs by their good Succeſs, and Proſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perity ſeems t'abate and diſſolve their Vigour, and do ſtop to take breath in the beſt of their way, and letting paſs good fortune before them, without the Courage of purſuing it, They loſe the ſight of it. But the <hi>Spaniards</hi> never Labour more than after a good Succeſs, and are never hotter to Fight, than after the gaining of a Battel,
<pb n="116" facs="tcp:33686:63"/>nor more deſirous to return to the Carier than after the Victory: They know how to purſue a Victory to the laſt, and they loſe not a happy Sequel that it may produce, nor a Fruit that may rationally be gathered from it, That of <hi>Norlinghen,</hi> to go no higher, is an evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent proof; and if <hi>France</hi> had not interpoſed to ſtop the Current, and reſtrain the Rapidity, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  <p>So that if the wonderful power of th' Houſe of <hi>Auſtria</hi> be conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered, which maintains it ſelf, and ſtands up after it hath received ſo many ſhakings; after the loſs of ſo many Battels; after th' Inſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection of Provinces and Kingdoms; And on th'other ſide, if their conſtant and politique Order, and the Virtues practiſed in the Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>binet Council, and exerciſed in the Field, be well obſerved, It muſt be confeſſed, that t'hinder the compleating of their Deſigns, it was neceſſary, that th'Heavens did undertake particularly to croſs them, and to raiſe Forces t'oppoſe them, equal or ſuperiour to theirs; A Policy at the leaſt as Wiſe, and incomparably more Juſt, and Vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tues as ſtrong and active, but more true and effective. Wherefore th'obligation, which the whole Chriſtian Common-wealth hath to the King, cannot be ſufficiently comprehended; And whatſoever th' Acknowledgment be, it cannot be proportionable t' his aid and him, for confirming its Liberty ſo violently ſhaken; for giving ſtop to th'Ambition of ſo powerful and Enemy; for having raiſed ſo great Forces upon that Occaſion, which might have been reported too great, but that they were neceſſary. The Reader will not take it ill, that I have here made this rough draught of the Conduct of that Houſe, and particularly of the Branch of <hi>Spain,</hi> which is as the Mobile and Soul of the Conduct of th' other. If it cannot entirely b'imitated by other Princes and States, for the Reaſons not here to b'expreſſed, It may be in part, and with ſome proportion. How<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever, 'tis no ſmall Matter t'have made it known, that a Defence may with Power and Knowledge be made againſt it.</p>
                  <p>Let's ſee now, if in theſe laſt Times <hi>France</hi> hath well underſtood the publick Myſtery, whereof it hath been ſpoken in the beginning of this Diſcourſe<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

To be ſatisfi'd in this, it muſt be ſuppoſed, That th' Intention of the King having been onely t' oppoſe th'unjuſt and unmeaſurable Greatneſs of th' Houſe of <hi>Auſtria,</hi> and t'hinder th'Uſurpations that it projected on all ſides to make; The Law of Contraries required, That he repaired chiefly to the places, where it endeavour'd to make its principal Eſtabliſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, and to break the Deſign, where the ſtrength of Induſtry ought to be, and the groſs of the Work which it deſigned; And it cannot be doubted, that almoſt in all the courſe of that long and ſad War, which devours <hi>Christendom,</hi> to the raiſing of the Siege at

                     <hi>Caſall,</hi> and to the riſing of the <hi>Catalans,</hi> which followed it, but the places have been <hi>Germany</hi> and <hi>Italy.</hi> As to the firſt, 'tis certain, That 'tis a conſtant Reſolution, and an Immortal Deſign in the Soul of thoſe Princes, who take up th'Empire, as by Succeſſion, to make al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo <hi>Germany</hi> their Patrimony. No perſon is ignorant what <hi>Charls</hi> the Fifth did, and what he did not, t'attain that End; And all the world knows alſo, and we do deduce it fully in the Treaty of Monarchy, How that Vaſt and Warlick Nation, whereof he did promiſe him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf the Conqueſt, did eſcape him, and broke the Nets, wherewith he had entangled them. We have ſeen where it failed, That th' Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perour did not finiſh the Work h' had more than half done.

W' have formerly obſerved th' Extreme peril the <hi>Swediſh</hi> Army, which had to that time been the Baſis of the good Party of <hi>Germany,</hi> run in th'Higher <hi>Palatinate,</hi> and how near that Foundation was to b'overthrown, and th'Imperial Party t'have gained th'Aſcendent, which might have been impoſſible for the <hi>Swedes</hi> t'have taken from them.</p>
                  <p>Moreover, as the flight from Evil is the firſt and the ſtrongeſt In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clination of Nature, and as the Smarts of Pain and Image of Death ſtir the Soul Livelier, than th'Attractive of Pleaſure, and th'Idaea of a Happy Life; ſo in th'Order of Paſſions which a Prince ought t'have for his Countreys, the love of Conſervation ought always to precede the deſire of Conqueſt; And before the thoughts of un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dertaking and making of any progreſs abrode, h'ought to provide for his ſafety within, and ought to ſubmit to the publick Preſerva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion at home, and cut off the Paſſages by which Diſorder might En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter. And therefore ſince <hi>Germany</hi> onely can do us the moſt conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable miſchief; ſince it is that Country which hath always ſent th'Armies which have always over-run <hi>France,</hi> and that 'tis certain, That if th'Imperial Arms ſhould be Victorious in <hi>Germany,</hi> they would not be confined to that Country, and that being augmented by th'Acceſs of Confederate Forces, and with a number of other Forces, who would run thither by a Conteſt of Envy, They would
<pb n="118" facs="tcp:33686:64"/>diſcharge themſelves upon our Country; They might fall into <hi>Italy,</hi> and make there the ſame Spoils, and cauſe the ſame Deſolation, as when they deſcended there under the command of <hi>Colaſto;</hi> or at leaſt, they might ſo fortifie the <hi>Spaniards</hi> there, and affright th' <hi>Ita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lians,</hi> that it would have been a great trouble t'us t'hinder them to finiſh the Deſigns, which th'had much advanced in <hi>Germany,</hi> and to divert th'<hi>Italians</hi> from accepting the Chains of Servitude or De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pendency which had been prepared for them of ſo many years.</p>
                  <p>Since, I ſay, that all this is poſſible, I conclude, that th'heat, which the King gave to th'Arms of the Late King of <hi>Swede,</hi> and which h' hath Continued to the Party he left in <hi>Germany;</hi> That th' endeavours h' uſed to raiſe it after it had been almoſt beaten down before <hi>North<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>linghen;</hi> That the Supplies of Money and Men which he ſent divers times into the Countrey; That the Treaties he made t' uphold th' Affairs, with the Late Duke of <hi>Weimar</hi> and the Troops he Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded, and with that Generous Princeſs,<note place="margin">Madam the <hi>Lantgrave</hi> of <hi>Heſſe.</hi>
                     </note> whoſe Judgement and Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtancy may ſerve for Example to the moſt Magnanimous Princes, and for ſhame to Cowards. I conclude, That whatſoever it hath Coſt or may coſt this Crown, That nothing was projected or done, but accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to the Rules of good Policy, and particularly according to the preventing of it, and not to ſtay till it hath made it Impreſſion for the Repelling of it. I go on, and ſay further, That the King not on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ought t' have ſent into <hi>Germany</hi> Forces capable of Conjunction with the Confederates, to Counterpoiſe and hold in Check th'Impe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rialiſts, as th' have done to this time; But that in that poſture the leaſt favour of Fortune might remove them out of Check, and that in a juſt Counterpoiſe, Nothing would be Eaſier for him than to make the Ballance fall on th'others ſide. This King then cannot be too much Commended for the Reſolution he took to ſend ſuch pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erfull Armes; That they put th'others Indubitably upon the defence; That they gave them Conſtantly the Law, and prepared a ſure way for the <hi>German</hi> Liberty, and for the General Peace of the Chriſtian Common-Wealth.</p>
                  <p>As t' <hi>Italy,</hi> there's no Queſtion to be made, but that it hath been a fixed and unchangable Deſign in the Spirit of the <hi>Spaniards</hi> to put th'<hi>Italians</hi> to the Yoak, and to Rob its Princes of all th'Eſtates they poſſeſſed there, or to reduce them to a Dependency which ſhould not be much different from Subjection, but by the Vanity of Titles and by th'Exteriour of Forms. There's No need of Refreſhing their Memory with th'Attempts of <hi>Charls</hi> the fifth, againſt the Liberty of this fair Countrey; The Violence he Committed and th' Ambuſhes he formed againſt it; That ſhall be repreſented at Length in the Treaty of Monarchy. There's no need alſo of Reporting all that the <hi>Spaniards</hi> undertook, ſince the Death of the late King; Sometimes againſt the Duke of <hi>Savoy;</hi> Sometimes againſt the <hi>Venetians,</hi> and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the <hi>Valtoline;</hi> Sometimes againſt the Duke of <hi>Mantoua;</hi> That's

That when the <hi>Spaniards</hi> had forced the Duke of <hi>Parma,</hi> Subdued the <hi>Griſons,</hi> Uſurped <hi>Zabionette</hi> and <hi>Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>randa,</hi> Invaded almoſt all <hi>Piedmont,</hi> and all the <hi>Montferrat,</hi> and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sieged <hi>Caſall,</hi> All th' hopes of its ſafety were reduced to th' Heroick Courage of a Prince, who would periſh, or ſave that place, and to the good ſucceſs of the King's Arms, which are not ſubject to th'Order of things, and ſometimes makes that facile which appears im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſſible.</p>
                  <p>I ſpeak not of our Expeditions in <hi>Flanders,</hi> where it ſeems the King for ſome years hath imploy'd the principal part of his Arms. It belongs not to me t'undertake the Revealing of that Myſtery, and t'hoiſe the ſail of a thing, which the Prudence of Governours would have ſecret. There are in the Matters of State places, as dangerous for particular perſons to talk of, as Banks and Sands are to them who ſail; And as to them, the Motives of the Conduct of wiſe Princes in many things, ought reſemble to the Roots of Trees, which are covered and inviſible, whilſt the Body and Branches are viſible; or to the Virtues of th' Heavens, whereof the Nature is not known, though th'Effects are felt, and the Power admired; So, no Queſtion is to be made, but the King had great Reaſons t'apply his Arms, as h'hath done, to the War of the <hi>Low-Countries,</hi> though they be not known t'all the World, and that the proſpects had on that ſide were Juſt, though they paſs the Reach of our ſight.</p>
                  <p>Beſides, what appeared and falls under the ſenſe of every perſon, which was to deliver our Frontiers from the Jealouſie they received from ſome of th'Enemies places, and chiefly to ſecure and re-inforce <hi>Paris</hi> the more, which is as th'Heart and Nobleſt part of <hi>France;</hi> He was alſo, it may be, engaged there by other Intereſts, which are not altogether his, and t'adjuſt himſelf to the Intereſts of ſome of his Neighbours, by that prudent Maxim of Policy, which holds forth, That great Perſons ought ſometimes to take the Law from their In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feriours, and follow their Motions when they have uſe of them; And that a Diſagreement would endanger th'Enterprize, If any of the Wheels, to which it ought to give Motion, came to fail and to be looſe from the others. It may be, that in the Subjects of great and profound Deſigns, which the King had upon that Country, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>e fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaw, that if they were all as happy, as they were wiſely projected, ſome Reſolution might happen, that would for ever deliver his Kingdom from Alarms, and from Incurſions, which are made ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times from that Neighbourhood. And truly, if th' Aſſault of <hi>Calo,</hi> and the Siege of St. <hi>Omer</hi> had proſpered, as in apparance they
<pb n="120" facs="tcp:33686:65"/>ought t'have done, or if an unexpected ſtroke, which made a Noiſe upon the Frontiers of <hi>Campagnia,</hi> had not diverted the favourable progreſs, which promiſed the taking of <hi>Ayres,</hi> Th' Effects of that Princes prevoyance, it may be, had been ſeen; It may b'alſo, That h' had a will to ſhut the Gates for a time, by which the Forces of <hi>Germany</hi> entring into <hi>Flanders,</hi> might over-run and make ſpoil in <hi>France.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>But when things changed their Countenance, and that the Riſings of the <hi>Catalans</hi> formed another Conjuncture, he changed alſo Conduct, and judged, as it hath been already obſerved, That after th'Affairs of <hi>Germany,</hi> there was none whereunto h' ought t' apply himſelf with more heat, and to make a greater ſhew of his Forces, than to them of that Country; He foreſaw, that the fruits which might be gathered from that Expedition, were not ordinary, and that th' advantages which might ariſe to the common cauſe might prove ſtrong Motives to the Peace, for which the War was made: For beſides, that the <hi>Spaniards</hi> could not long act powerfully in <hi>Spain,</hi> in <hi>Flanders,</hi> and in <hi>Italy,</hi> and the nouriſhment they ought to give to their Original Country, would conſume the food of th' others Countrie, If the King of <hi>Hungary</hi> was ſeen full of troubles in <hi>Germany,</hi> and the King of <hi>Spain</hi> aſſaulted in th'Heart of his Eſtates, and troubled to defend his Life. It was not impoſſible, but that two Benefits alſo might ariſe very conſiderable; Th'one, that the Princes of <hi>Germany,</hi> ſeparated from the good Party, might take courage to rejoyn with it; Th'other, that the League, wherein to that time they had laboured unprofitably, t'introduce th'<hi>Italian</hi> Princes, might be formed, and that they would not loſe ſo fair an occaſion to drive them away, who had ſtollen the Liberty of their Country, and to take away the mixture and confuſion of Nations, and forein Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners, which ſully and disfigure it. For t'imagine, that for leſs than that, the <hi>Republique</hi> of <hi>Venice,</hi> the moſt conſiderable of all thoſe Princes, for what concerns Temporal things; That can give a ſhaking t'other Princes, and after that make no difficulty t'enter the Lifts it had opened, would be perſwaded to that League, 'Tis to b'ignorant of their ſpirit; It were to b' a ſtranger to their Maxims; And to believe, what is deſired, upon the ſingle Motions of paſſion. This point ſhall b'examin'd in the following Diſcourſe, this having been but too long. I add onely, for adviſe of them who might find cauſe to deſire ſomething here on our part upon the ſubject of great Extremities, wherein th'Affairs have ſometimes fallen in <hi>Germany</hi> and <hi>Italy;</hi> That the King could not do all things in all places, and that it may be he had done too much, as hath elſe-where been ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved, but for an abſolute Neceſſity and Inevitable, even for the good of his own Kingdom, to do it; That he could not alone divert all th'Evils that might happen in that Country, by the failings and inſenſibility of them, who were more interreſſed than himſelf, and for whoſe Liberty he took ſo great pains, and made ſo great an
<pb n="121" facs="tcp:33686:65"/>Expence; That in the courſe and great variety of Affairs, which exerciſed him, he could not always ordain, That they who received his Orders, ſhould b'as happy t'execute them, and to compleat them, as he was prudent in laying of the Deſign, and preparing the Model; But 'tis a wonder, which will appear almoſt incredible to future Ages, and will be one of the faireſt Beams of the glory of this Prince; and one of the Nobleſt Monuments of his Incomparable Reign, That by his Wiſdom, his Courage, and his Power, he raiſed at home, and with his Allies, what was ready to Fall; That he did ſet ſtraight there all that began to Lean, and ever diſappointed Fortune of her Malitious Progreſs, and of the Conſequences of her Surprizes.</p>

                  <head type="sub">In what Conjuncture it may be probably thought, That the <hi>Venetians</hi> will enter int' a League againſt the <hi>Spaniards.</hi>
                  </head>
                  <p>THough I do not think it neceſſary that this League, whereof hath been ſpoken, be made, or that the time of a General Peace be ſo backward, as t'attend the finiſhing of ſo difficult a Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gotiation; I have believed nevertheleſs, that it would not b'imper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinent for me to ſpeak my thoughts, to make the Genius of the <hi>Ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>netian</hi> Republique to be the better known, and what may b' ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pected from it on like Occaſions, and at the ſame time to make it ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear to th' Author of a ſmall Pamphlet, which appeared a little after the laſt Stege of <hi>Caſal,</hi> under the name of a <hi>Montferrat</hi> Soldier, That the Seaſon was not then come to form that League, as he did pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend it, and that the King was not ripe, according to the Senſe of that Republique, and the Maxims of their Policy.</p>
                  <p>The foundation whereupon I do build my Opinion is this, That it being th'ordinary Nature of Republiques to be very diſtruſtful, and to fear more than hope, when th'Apparances of Evil and Good are equal; It may be ſaid, That <hi>Venice,</hi> of all other Republiques, Labours moſt of that humour; And that th'Inclination it hath in all it undertakes to give the leaſt it can t'Hazard, and the moſt to Pru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence, is the cauſe, that 'tis ſeldom enclined for the War, which is an Element of Fortune, unleſs an extreme Danger do force it, or a viſible Benefit invite it. I could bring a number of antient Examples to confirm this Truth, if I did not believe, that Modern would be of moſt uſe and credit, as moſt efficacious, and of greater Inſtruction than th'others. In that high and wonderful Deſign, which the late King had formed againſt th'Houſe of <hi>Auſtria,</hi> and to put the Quiet of <hi>Christendom,</hi> ſo often troubled by that Houſe, in ſome ſtate of conſiſtency, he cauſed the Republique to be ſolicited to be of the Party; And notwithſtanding the power h' had with them, which could not be greater, and th' Advantages h' had propoſed unto

                     </gap>ts of the Conqueſt, whereof the greateſt part was to be at his Charges, and by his Forces, were to be gathered for th'<hi>Italians,</hi> and that he reſerved onely the glory of being their Liberator, and to make the <hi>Spaniards</hi> loſe the place of drawing together the greateſt part of their Armies, which was then the State of <hi>Milan;</hi> Yet he could never draw from that Republique, but general Words of Good-will and of Praiſes, which were uttered above meaſure, as 'tis its cuſtom, to that Magnanimous Prince, who had no leſſer Thoughts than to be the Flayl and th'Exterminator of Tyrants, the Reſtorer and Arbiter of the Chriſtian Common-wealth.</p>
                  <p>The Republique then of <hi>Venice</hi> was not ſo blinded with the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſals that were made unto it, nor with th'Apparences wherewith they were cloathed, but that they had before their Eyes th'Inſtability of Human Things, and th'ordinary Games of Fortune, the perpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual Motion of her Wheel, and the ſudden and frequent Revolu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions which ſh' occaſions in the World. It apprehended, that before the Work, whereof the Platform was repreſented was finiſhed, or elſe well begun, th'undertaker might fail, either by a natural Death, which would not be ſtrange, or by a violent End, which was not without Example. It deſired to ſee all the Contexture of the League; The Seat and Action of the Pieces of that Engine, and the Succeſs of its firſt Motions; That if it ſaw cauſe to renounce it, or to b'aſſaulted with ſome ſad Accident, there might be no cauſe of Repentance for Joyning, not t' accuſe themſelves of Precipita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion and of falling, for having made too much haſte; That if th'Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vens look'd favourably upon that League, and gave it a propitious Wind, It knew well, that the door would b'always open unto't; It knew, that without her, th' Expedition which was diſcourſed of for <hi>Italy,</hi> would be weak and lame, and that the perfections of its good ſucceſs depended upon the conjunction of their Arms with thoſe of other Princes. And then in entring the League it ſhould run but a little hazard, and make but a ſmall Advance of Moneys; It might find th'Harveſt ready; It would have nothing to do, but to purſue the Remainders of the Victory, and ſhould come rather to the Dividing, than Taking of the Prey. Such was the belief of the late King upon the Demeanor of that Republique, and to that purpoſe he gave charge to <hi>Sir</hi> of <hi>Bullion</hi> to ſpeak to the Duke of <hi>Savoy,</hi> to whom h'had ſent him to Conclude and Terminate the League, which the <hi>Sirs</hi> of <hi>Nemours</hi> and of <hi>Vaucelas</hi> had begun with him. The Reader may ſee it at length in th' Inſtruction given to the <hi>Sir</hi> of <hi>Bouillon,</hi> which in my opinion is a very excellent Piece, and one of the beſt things that I have ſeen in its kind. Let's go on.</p>
                  <p>After that <hi>Cordova</hi> had beſieged <hi>Caſall,</hi> and by an Attempt, whoſe
<pb n="123" facs="tcp:33686:66"/>beginning wanted a pretence to colour it; And had made it appear to th'<hi>Italians,</hi> That his Maſter would make no difference betwixt what might accommodate him, and what did belong to him; The Republique armed vigorouſly, and made ſome demonſtration of intereſſing themſelves in that Quarel. Nevertheleſs, of whatſoever Importance the conſervation of <hi>Caſal</hi> was for the ſafety of <hi>Italy,</hi> and though th' Ambition of <hi>Spain</hi> had not a ſtronger Barrier in that Country than that place; The Republique could never be perſwaded to relieve it, or to ſend their Army into <hi>Montferrat</hi> t'aſſault <hi>Cordova</hi>'s Army, which was not Invincible, or to make a diverſion on <hi>Cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mona</hi>'s ſide, which was very eaſie to be done. But after it had ſeen th'happy Succeſs of the Siege of <hi>Rochel,</hi> and the paſſage of <hi>Suza</hi> forced, and by conſequence one of the Gates of <hi>Italy</hi> open t'our Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies; The Republique reſolved to command their Arms t'enter into the State of <hi>Milan,</hi> in whoſe defence it ſaw but a few Aſtoniſhed Troops, and the Reliques of an Army, which Winter and the Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſieged had ill uſed before <hi>Caſal,</hi> and which had no ſtrength, but to flie and to ſave it ſelf at the ſight of ours.</p>
                  <p>Though it was ſo, and that probably the fruits of the Victory the King had obtained could not be more certain or more fruitful, if it had been purſued; Though it ſeemed then, that no labour re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mained, but to gather the Favours which Fortune offered us of Her ſelf, and to receive what would be rendred, yet many ſtrokes ought t'have been made, and Combats fought, to make the Republique reſolve to ſend Orders to their Generals to paſs the <hi>Rubicon;</hi> That is, t'enter with a Warlike Poſture into <hi>Cremona,</hi> and to Leap the Bounds had been almoſt an Age Sacred and Inviolable unto them. It was not without a long Agitation of Thoughts and extreme La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour of Spirit, that it was perſwaded to that bold Reſolution; Th'Eloquence and Addreſs of <hi>Sir</hi> of <hi>Avaux,</hi> how great ſoever, was never more puſled than to make the Republique t' undertake it; It brought the ſame Formalities, and the ſame Precautions, as when it determin'd t'accept the War, which th'<hi>Herald</hi> of <hi>Lewis</hi> the 12<hi rend="sup">th</hi> de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clared againſt it on the behalf of the League of <hi>Cambray;</hi> Or that which the <hi>Chaoux</hi> of <hi>Selim</hi> the Second did intimate unto't for the poſſeſſion of <hi>Cyprus:</hi> And ſince, after that, for Important Conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rations, which I have touched in the Firſt Part, the King had ſtop<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ped the courſe of the Victory of <hi>Suza,</hi> and given Peace to the <hi>Spa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niards,</hi> who were no longer in a condition to d'Evil t'our affairs; The Republique many times avowed to <hi>Sir</hi> of <hi>Avaux,</hi> That their Reſolution to break ſo ſuddenly with <hi>Spain</hi> was Matter of great Aſtoniſhment to them, and was done by a kind of ſurprize, and contrary to th'ordinary courſe of their Conduct, ſo far t'Engage in the Quarrel of the Duke of <hi>Mantoua.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>It may alſo b'obſerved by the War, or rather by the Perſecution which the late Emperour and the King of <hi>Spain</hi> exerciſed upon that Duke, That 'tis very hard to draw the <hi>Venetians</hi> t' an Offenſive
<pb n="124" facs="tcp:33686:67"/>League, and t'engage them in a War, but by the Temptation of ſome great Advantage, which may appear to them as infallible, or by the Fear of a great Evil, which aſſaults them with Fury, and is ready, if it be not ſtaid, to break upon them. So they could not b'in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duc'd to draw into the Field againſt the <hi>Spaniards,</hi> when <hi>Caſal</hi> was at Bay, and all the <hi>Montferrat</hi> at Mercy; Till they ſaw on th'other ſide the Mountains, the <hi>French</hi> Colours to be diſplaied, and with them th'Hopes of the Conqueſt of <hi>Milan,</hi> and of the partition of that fair Country, which ſeem'd to b'open'd unto them by the For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune of <hi>France;</hi> When they ſaw <hi>Mantoua</hi> in danger, and upon th'in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant of loſs; When they ſaw that th'Affair preſt on that ſide, and that th'Evil was Inviolence; And by conſequence, that the place which, in th'Hand of the Duke of <hi>Mantoua,</hi> ſerved for a Rampart to ſome parts of their Country on the Land-ſide, falling into th'Hands of th'Emperour or the King of <hi>Spain,</hi> would be made as a Cittadel to command it; They gave orders for their Army t' ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vance for the Relief of <hi>Mantoua.</hi> But whether the Remedy came too late, or that the Malady was no longer capable of Cure, or that th'ill Conduct or Imprudence of them, who were ordered to diſpenſe it, corrupted the Virtue, or hindred th'Operation, It hapned, that it did not produce th'effect which the <hi>Venetians</hi> had propoſed to them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelees, and t'expreſs the matter, as it was; The delays they uſed in reſolving upon that Relief; Th'Order of that Deſign the Duke of <hi>Rohan</hi> had contrived, which one of the chief Commanders of their Army changed by Jealouſie, and th' Ill Intelligence which did ariſe betwixt the Duke of <hi>Candale</hi> and the Marſhal of <hi>Estree,</hi> were the fatal Cauſes of the Loſſe of a place, which was of ſo great Concernment to the <hi>Venetians</hi> to Conſerve. I conclude, from hence, That th' Eminent danger which excites them t' Act, hang<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing no longer over their Head, and the defeat of the <hi>Spaniards</hi> before <hi>Caſall;</hi> the great loſſes they ſuffered before <hi>Thurin;</hi> And th' other diſgraces which have ſince hapned unto them, Having diſſipa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted the fears they Laboured of, leſt the <hi>Spaniards</hi> ſhould extend their Invaſions upon the reſt of <hi>Italy;</hi> And ſeeing that the Fortune of th' Houſe of <hi>Auſtria</hi> was Highly ſuſtained in <hi>Germany,</hi> and that the Spring which might ſend powerfull Reliefs to the State of <hi>Milan</hi> was not drawn drye, 'Tis not to be wondred, if they do refuſe t' embarke in a Quarrel, wherein there's no great Evill for them to fear, nor certain good t'hope for, in caſe they did embarque in it. But if they ſaw the Confederate Forces Superiour, and prevalent in <hi>Germany,</hi> as they ſaw in <hi>Spain,</hi> the Seeds of a long War, and the Matter of a laſting Quarrel; And by conſequent, that it ſhould act no more in <hi>Italy,</hi> but by languiſhing and weak Means; There's probability that they would make uſe of the Conjuncture, and would have been glad t'have gained ſome part of the State of <hi>Milan,</hi> which might have been convenient for them; Or at leaſt, that they would put them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves int' a poſture to make the <hi>Spaniards</hi> throw up th'Uſurpations
<pb n="125" facs="tcp:33686:67"/>th' had made in <hi>Piedmont</hi> and <hi>Montferrat,</hi> being able to do't ſafely and without fear of Revenge. And in truth, it would be a ſtrange and very unjuſt thing, that being ſo intereſſed as they are in the Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty of <hi>Italy,</hi> and having ſo much there to loſe, they ſhould ever ſtand there, as immoveable Spectators of what paſſeth in that Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try; And in reſt and eaſe, leave their Friends always to labour the Work of their Safety, and contribute nothing to th' advancement of the Peace, and raiſing of the Temple, that is prepared for them; but Idle Reaſonings; but ſuperfluous Wiſhes and Endeavours without Effect. For that Peace, I ſay, which is th' End of the Kings Arms, and th'object of his Hotteſt and Conſtant deſires, for which, He lays up ſo many Cares and Labours; Expoſeth His Perſon to ſo many Dangers, and draws ſo much Money from the purſes of his Subjects, and ſo much bloud from their Veins; for that Peace, which ought not only t'eaſe the Wounds of <hi>Chriſtendome,</hi> but ought fully t' Heal and ſtrengthen it; which ought not only to be a Remedy againſt preſent, but alſo a preſervation againſt future Evils; which ought to put In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feriour Perſons in ſafety from the Violence and Attempts of the grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſt Perſons, and under whoſe ſhadow all ſhall enjoy what ſhall be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>long to them without Trouble or Jealouſie.</p>

                  <p>'Tis of this Matter, that the peace whereof Chriſtendome hath need, ought to be made, that it may be durable; 'Tis upon this Baſis that it ought to be raiſed, if Men would have it ſubſiſt. Beſides this way, I do not ſee, That ſtrength Enough or ſubſiſtence can be given it; And 'tis certain, that if the Confederates ſhall be tempted by the Baits and Advantages, which will be preſented unto them by par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular Treaties, and that the Members of the League do ſever from the body, that they compoſe; They will infallibly be loſt; And it will befall them, as to thoſe Inſects, which are cut in peeces, that preſerve for a little time ſome Motion and Life, but Dye and Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſh a little after, for being deprived of the Virtue, that did ariſe from th Union of all the parts, as the Principle of their Duration. From whence it may be ſeen, what Imprudence the Duke of <hi>Saxe</hi> is guilty of, and th'other Princes of <hi>Germany</hi> who followed the courſe of the firſt Mobile, to ſever themſelves from the <hi>Swediſh</hi> Alliance. For, without ſpeaking of th'offence committed againſt Honeſty, by that ſeparation whereof, mention hath been made; of that Villainous Blot of Ingratitude, wherewith they have Charged themſelves in the Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mory of a Prince to whom they were ſo much indebted; Their In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſts obliged them alwaies to ſtand united; And inſtead of that unlucky Peace of <hi>Prague,</hi> which was ſold unto them ſo dear; They ſhould have Laboured a General peace, which had not left open any Wounds nor Burning-firebrands in th' Empire; which had not left any Snares, nor concealed any Ambuſhes, and which might have been gained by a ſhorter or a leſs grievous War, than that which was ſhut up in th'other and yet continues. In Effect, if Powder had not been Caſt into th'Eyes of thoſe Princes, and if their Councel had not deceived them; If ſome little Light or ſome little Liberty had been left them to ſee, what they did, or t'hinder the doing of it; Is there any Apparence but that they had ſeen the Precipice, whither they brought them, or that they would have deſcended Voluntarily into it? Is there any Probability that they would have taken ſo groſly th'Exchange that was given them; That they would depart from a Society to put themſelves into Chains, and that from Equals and Companions as they were of the <hi>Swedes,</hi> They would have made themſelves ſlaves of th'Imperialiſts, and Dependents upon the <hi>Spani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ards?</hi>
                     <pb n="127" facs="tcp:33686:68"/>Would they not have Known, that inſtead of paſſing by a light diſcontent and a ſmall diſtaſte received from one of the Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters of State of the Crown of <hi>Swede,</hi> wherein an eaſie Remedy might have been found, They expoſed themſelves t' all th'Injuries, which Tyranny hath Accuſtomed to practiſe with them, of whom they will b'aſſured, and are afraid of, leſt they ſhould Eſcape them? That in th' Alliance of that Crown, what they Contributed to th' Enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainment of the War, was voluntary, or could not exceed the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tents of the Conditions of the Treaty; what they ought to Contribute to that of th'Emperours, had no other Limits but their want of pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er; That the Charge of th'Expence, which they would be obliged to make would re-double without ſtint, and would b' Heavy without Meaſure; And that they would not leſs endeavour in that deceifull and unfaithful Confederation to cauſe all their Heat and Spirits to b' exhaled, and to draw from them Monies and Men, Than t'extermi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate the <hi>Swedes</hi> out of <hi>Germany,</hi> and to purge, as they ſay, th'Empire of forein Nations, wh' have Caſt themſelves into 't, that they might have nothing to doe, but with them, when they 've done with o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers?</p>
                  <p>If from the Principles of the <hi>Spaniſh</hi> Policies, which Reign as freely at <hi>Vienna</hi> as at <hi>Madrid,</hi> they will not draw ſo neceſſary a Concluſion; Let them inferr it at leaſt from their own Experience, and Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider, That if others would not Hold them but by the Bands of Friendſhip, and by the ſenſe of good Turnes; if they had not a deſign to Conſume them in deſtroying the <hi>Swedes</hi> and other Strangers, and to make uſe of them againſt <hi>Swedes</hi> and Strangers, as the Refiners do Lead, to Purifie Gold and Silver in the Refining Veſſel, which, in the ſame inſtant it ſends into ſmoak th' other imperfect Metalls, Evaporates it ſelf and is loſt with them it forceth away. They would not have made, as they have done to their power their Countries the Theatre of the War; They would not have made the ſame ſcorn of their Troops, as of their Enemies; And they ſhould have recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved at leaſt, as gentle Entertainment, as what the Duke of <hi>Baviere</hi> received. Let them remember the diſcourſe held at <hi>Rome</hi> by th' Ambaſſadors of the Late Emperor upon the Complaints there made of the Conceſſion their Maſter had granted of the Goods of the Church to the Duke of <hi>Saxe,</hi> to the great Damage and Diſdain of Religion, and to the great ſcandal of good Catholiques. That it was the ſmall Aid and Subvention received from th'<hi>Holy Chair,</hi> which conſtrained him; That it was the Violence of his Affairs that had forced him; And that it was th'hardeſt and moſt Inexorable of all Laws, That of Neceſſity to which He had obeyed.</p>
                  <p>Let the Clearing now of this Myſtery and of the Concealed ſenſe of theſe Words b'examined; Let the ſecret ſpirit they contain be drawn out; And it may be Judged in my opinion, That that peace Holding more of Force than of Election, and Being rather torn, than freely paſt from the Will of th'Emperor; There would be no want
<pb n="128" facs="tcp:33686:69"/>of Doctors to prove that it ought not to b' obſerved, at leaſt by his Succeſſors who had not made it; That they could not b' obliged t'hold what was not lawfull for their Predeceſſors to grant, and that no Promiſes were more unlawfull, and whoſe Ligament is ſooner to be Cut, and Damage repaired, than ſuch as wound Religion, and diſſipate the goods of the Church, for the Protection and Defence whereof, they 've a particular and inevitable Obligation. The Princes then, who 've quitted the Confederations ſo Solemnly ſworn, and ſo often renewed with their true Friends, to caſt them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves into the peace of <hi>Prague,</hi> ought t' hold for certain, that they 've abandoned the purſute of a Reality, and of a Body, t'embrace an Apparition and a ſhadow; And that there's but one of theſe three wayes open to their future Condition, Either to remain for the final prey of th'Imperialiſts, as hath been expreſſed, and to make up the Concluſion of the Game they play in <hi>Germany,</hi> if the Confederate party be ſubdued; or if the Victory fall on the <hi>Swedes</hi> ſide, T' en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dure the Troubles of the violation of publique Faith, and th'Effects of the Vengeance which the bloud of the King of <hi>Swede</hi> requires, poured out for the Redemption of their Liberty; or at laſt, if they will ſee the Truth of this <hi>Amneſtia,</hi> which is the Subject of the Confederate Armes, inſtead of that other Imaginary, which hath been the Bait, wherewith th' Houſe of <hi>Auſtria</hi> hath caught them; If they would ſee the Conſtitutions and th' Ancient Order of th'Empire to reflouriſh; If they woud ſee a perpetual Fence made to th' Ambition of them that throw it open, That I ſay, This may be done Quickly and Ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſily, There's nothing to be done, but to return to the good Party, and to rejoyn with them who Labour with ſo much vehemency at this Immortal work. I go on and ſay alſo, That as there's no doubt to be made but th' Houſe of <hi>Austria</hi> will move all the Wheels of their Policy to diſunite the League, which is on foot in <hi>Germany,</hi> and to reduce the preſent Troubles to particular peaces, and like to that of <hi>Prague;</hi> And 'tis not, I ſay, to be doubted, but it will be made, that every one of the Confederates Engaged for his particular, and ſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red from the body of the League, may be found the weaker to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſt him, when he ſhall be Aſſaulted, Though the Contrary be pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſed. And to be ſecured from this Inconveniency, 'Tis neceſſary to take the Counter Courſe taken by that Houſe, and to put in pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctice the Law of Contraries, which is of ſo great Uſe in th' Affairs of the World; All the Confederates ought to reſolve never t' Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>unite; To reject all propoſals, that may be made them of particular Treaties, as a deſigned Poyſon which ſhall be preſented to them in the form of a Remedy; and t'Inſiſt upon it till it be concluded in the project of a General Peace; That it be not declined, till it be Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compliſhed, and in ſuch a Defenſive League, as I've here above deſcribed.</p>
                  <p>But leſt, that in Threatning them with the Licenſe, which is ſaid, Th' Houſe of <hi>Auſtria</hi> gives it ſelf to violate all Treaties, whoſe
<pb n="129" facs="tcp:33686:69"/>Obſervation is Damageable, and the not Obſervation Advantagious unto it, I may give them a falſe Alarm, and raiſe fear from a falſe Imagination. It may be, that 'tis as Carefull to perform what ſhe Promiſeth, and particularly, when the Name of God is Interpoſed, as it hath been, th' other ſpecious Apparences of Piety, and th' out-ſide of Exemplary Religion; And that it Aims at nothing more than a good Peace, and that its Intention is, when it hath gained this Haven, to put it ſelf no more in danger for the Future, unleſs it be forced upon ſo Dangerous a Sea, as the Warr. I will demonſtrate here the Contrary, and make it Evident, That in truth, it gives it ſelf that Licenſe, and that it doth abuſe the Name of God, and plaies with the Publick Faith, when their Intereſts require it, more than any Prince of the World. For this purpoſe, I do not intend to play the Orator, nor to make uſe of an Art, which boaſts of her Colours, and lights, to Change, when it pleaſeth the ſtate of Things, and to make them ſeem Great or Little, Fair or Ugly, when it ſhall ſeem good unto Her; This is as much Eſtranged from my Humours, as 'tis above my Forces; And I do Heartily renounce an Exerciſe, which I ſhould diſcharge Unhandſomely, if I did un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dertake it. I will not here neither, produce all the Breaches of the Treaties, which this Houſe of <hi>Auſtria</hi> hath made, nor all th' Infide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lities, wherewith it hath ſtained its Conduct. Great Volumes are only capable to Contain them. I will touch only upon ſomewhat more Modern, as more Senſible, and upon what hath paſſed in theſe latter times in <hi>Germany</hi> and <hi>Italy.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>As t' <hi>Italy,</hi> who knows not that the laſt Warrs the <hi>Spaniards</hi> have made to the Duke of <hi>Savoy,</hi> Grand-father to this Duke, have alwaies budded from the Breach on their part of th' Treaties, which preceded? And ſo ſoon as the fear of th' Evil, which had Obliged them for Accomodation, was over, and that the hope of th' End which they had Propoſed to their Arms, began to Revive, They loſt the Memory of the Peace they had Sworn, and made no Diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culty to renew the Quarrel, and to re-kindle the Diſorder at the Charges of their Faith, and againſt all Juſtice. So that what Inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vened betwixt two Warrs, was not ſo much Peace as a Suſpenſion of Arms, nor the Cure of the Feaver, as the Remiſſion of th' Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſs; The fire was Covered under th' Aſhes, but Dyed not in th' Intention of the <hi>Spaniards,</hi> and it hapned t' all that Affair, as to Wounds ill Dreſſed, which often break out; It was renewed fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently; And that Game laſted till new Accidents made the <hi>Spa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niards</hi> take new Deſigns, and that the Troubles of <hi>Germany</hi> allayed them of <hi>Italy.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>I ſpeak not here of the Peace of <hi>Suza,</hi> which they Violated with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out other Colour, than that they were Neceſſitated to do 't, for th' Intereſt of their Reputation; nor of th' Ingratitude, wherewith they requited the Courteſie, which the King did in their behalf, and that rare Moderation which made him bound his Proſperity by the
<pb n="130" facs="tcp:33686:70"/>delivery of his Allies, and permitted him not t' Overcome, but where it found Reſiſtance. It hath been ſpoken of in another place, and ſhall be Spoken of more fully in the Third Part. I remit alſo to ſpeak there of the Treaty of <hi>Cuiraſque,</hi> which the Neceſſity of the <hi>German</hi> Affairs forced from them, rather than the Love of the Peace of <hi>Italy;</hi> And to which, the Reſolutions of the Dyet of <hi>Ratis<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  <p>That will be ſeen in the Third Part, in th' Apology of the Treaty of <hi>Moncon,</hi> where I give a very Exact Table of th' Affairs of that Common-wealth. I come to them of <hi>Germany,</hi> and to what paſſed upon that Scean, not leſs Famous by the Treaties, than by the Warrs, which were managed there: Who knows not that the Peace of <hi>Ulmes,</hi> Concluded by the Mediation of <hi>France,</hi> gave Means to th' Emperour t' Eaſe himſelf of the Weight of the Warr under which he Groaned, and t' unravel the Perplexities from which he could not be diſ-intangled but by that Expedient? And who knows not alſo, That he obſerved it no longer than was Neceſſary for to prepare for a Warr, which he reſolved in Swearing the Peace; And that the Ruine of the Count <hi>Palatine,</hi> and of his Friends, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeded only from the Confidence they raiſed in that Treaty, and from that Ruinous Foundation, whereupon they truſted, as upon an Holy Anchor, by the Right of Nations, by the Reverence of the Name of God, which therein was Interpoſed, and by th' Authority of ſo Great a Mediator as the King of <hi>France?</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>After the Gain of the Battel of <hi>Prague,</hi> and that fatal Series of Proſperities which follows great Victories; After that th' Imperial Arms had Triumphed over all that favoured the <hi>Palatines</hi> party, and that the Count of <hi>Tilly,</hi> and Marquiſs of <hi>Spinola,</hi> had ſtripped Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked that unhappy Prince, Th' Emperour transferred his Electorate to the Duke of <hi>Baviere,</hi> and divided his Country between him and the King of <hi>Spain;</hi> But it being pretended, that the Formalities Ordained by the Golden Charter, and by th' other Pragmatique Sanctions, had not been obſerved in that Tranſlation and Partition; and for fear, that proceeding which they ſuppoſed to be Violent, ſhould Offend th' other <hi>Electors</hi> by a common Intereſt, and Provoke
<pb n="131" facs="tcp:33686:70"/>the King of <hi>England</hi> to a Revenge, and to Proſecute the Reparation of th' Out-rage done to his Son-in-Law; Th' Emperour proteſted in the Dyet of <hi>Ratisbone,</hi> in the year 1662. <hi>That h' had transferred th' Electorate to th' Houſe of</hi> Bavi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>re <hi>for the Dukes Life only, that was Inveſted with it; And for what Concerned the Palatinate, he would make Reparation to the Count</hi> Palatine, <hi>and give Satisfaction thereupon to his Friends: He gave the ſame Aſſurances to the King of</hi> England <hi>by his Letters, in the year</hi> 1623. which the Duke of <hi>Baviere</hi> alſo Confirmed by his Letters, and ſignified the King; He underſtood that it was only for his Life, that his Houſe ſhould Enjoy th' Electo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral Dignity, and that h' had Accepted it upon Condition of Return to th' Houſe, from whence it was taken, and ſhould be the Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vilege of his Perſon, and not th' Inheritance of his Heirs. It was th' Allay that was alwaies Preſented to the King of <hi>England,</hi> and wherewith he Suffered himſelf alwaies to be Surprized; And his Inclination naturally diſpoſed to the Sweetneſs of Reſt, and to the Delicacies of Peace, was Eaſily diverted by that ſhew, which was made of giving him Content, from the Thoughts of Warr, which were not Natural to him. In th' Expectation of th' Effects of thoſe hopes, he finiſhed his Life, which from time to time were renewed unto him; And th' Earl of <hi>Gondemar,</hi> who had ſeized upon the Kings Underſtanding, and taken Soveraign Poſſeſſion of it to Govern him abſolutely, knew how to repreſent th' Execution of that Affair ſo infallible, as not only t' Hinder the King from Arming againſt the Uſurpators of his Son-in-Laws Lands, but Enclined him alſo to Lend Ships to his Maſter, to ſecure againſt th' <hi>Hollanders the Spaniſh Fleets,</hi> which Sailed from th' <hi>Indies.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>That buſineſs hath ever ſince been in the ſame Condition on th' Emperours part, and ſtood alwaies floting in Irreſolution and In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>certitude, till the Accident of <hi>Northlinghen,</hi> which was fatal to the <hi>Swedes.</hi> The greareſt part of the Princes, and free Towns of th' Empire, fell from their Confederation, and Conſpired at <hi>Prague</hi> with th' Houſe of <hi>Austria,</hi> againſt the <hi>German</hi> Liberty. Th' Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour High and Proud with his prodigious Succeſs, and believing himſelf Maſter of Affairs and Fortune, forgetting the Promiſes he had ſo Solemnly made to the Late King of <hi>England,</hi> and the Faith h' had ſo often given him in Favour of his Son-in-Law, though nothing had paſſed againſt him on that Princes occaſion, nor by the Means of his Children, but a Sad and Lamentable Progreſs of Calamity, and of Diſgraces, declared by his own Authority, (though he could not Lawfully do it) but by th' Authority of a Lawfull Dyet, and all Parties heard, declared I ſay, <hi>Th' Electorate duely Tranſlated to the Duke of</hi> Bavaria, <hi>and to his Heirs, and that it could not Devolve t' any other Family till his was Extinguiſhed;</hi> More<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>over, <hi>He declared th' Oppoſition made by the Duke of</hi> Newbourge, <hi>as Prince of the</hi> Palatine <hi>Family, to be Void, and that he was not to b' admitted upon his Claim; And that this was done upon great and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portant
<pb n="132" facs="tcp:33686:71"/>Conſiderations, known t' his Imperial Majesty; That he Main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained and Confirmed in the Partition and Poſſeſſion of the Palatinate, them, Wh' had taken it in his Name, and by his Authority, with Reſpect to b' had to the Count Palatines,</hi> and to the Requeſts of Princes, who ſhould Intercede for them, and under ſuch baſe and ſhamefull Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditions, That he knew well they would never b' Accepted.</p>
                  <p>But remembring the Bloody affront done to the preſent King of <hi>England,</hi> and the Counterpoiſe that he might bring to the Ballance, where the Victory hung betwixt two Parties, if he ſhould declare for his Enemy; Remembring alſo the Damages the <hi>Low-Country<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men</hi> would receive in the Ceſſation of the Recruits th' <hi>Engliſh</hi> might bring them; And other Conſequences that might ariſe from th' Hatred of a Prince, provoked to Revenge by frequent diſdains offe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red unto him, and by th' Extreme injuries done t' his Nephews; He re-aſſumed the Foxes skinn, which h' had put off at the Treaty of <hi>Prague,</hi> and Exerciſed the firſt Art, wherewith h' had ſo often play'd his Game with the Father, t' abuſe the Son, and to ſuſpend the Reſolution he might take, to ſeek by Force, what had been de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nied t' his Interceſſion and Endeavours. He made ſhew then of Entertaining the profers of Accommodation, which were made to Him; He received the King of <hi>Englands</hi> Meſſage for that purpoſe, and ſeemed to deſire a Solemn Embaſſage t' yield with the greater Honour, and to give the more Glory to the Treaty he would Conclude. But th' Journey of th' Earl of <hi>Arundel;</hi> The ſeveral Diſtaſt<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>rs, which he there received, and the Diſſatisfaction, which at laſt he brought back, made Clearly manifeſt to the World, the Truth of th' Emperours Intentions, and that it was a ſtudied Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tifice to gain Time, and to try the Fortune of Warr with the more Advantage, having to do with the fewer Enemies.</p>
                  <p>I ſpeak not of what hapned to the laſt Ambaſſadour, that was ſent from <hi>England,</hi> nor of the ſucceſs of his Embaſſy, which hath not given the Lye to the former; 'Tis a matter too new and preſent to b' unknown by any Perſon. And this may be ſaid in favour of th' Houſe of <hi>Austria,</hi> That it being neceſſary, the Treaty to be Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluded, ſhould be debated by the King and <hi>Parliament</hi> of the <hi>King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome;</hi> The time was not proper for it, whilſt the <hi>King</hi> and his Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament were divided; That truly is not without Reaſon and plauſible Pretence, but the ſecret of th' Affairs is, That ſo long as the Schiſm ſhall laſt, and the Fire which th' <hi>Engliſh</hi> have kindled in the midſt of their Country, be maintained in Heat and Force, The King of <hi>Hungary,</hi> and they of his Party, have no Cauſe to fear their Arms, nor t' haſten a Treaty. And if it b' Expedient, that they treat in Earneſt, it may be time enough, when th' <hi>Engliſh</hi> have re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>aſſumed their former Union, and the deſign of reſtoring the <hi>Palatines</hi> Houſe, and re-eſtabliſhing of the Princes, th' Emperour and his Adherents had ſtripped to their Shirts.</p>
                  <p>That whilſt they run th' Hazard of the Warr, either they may
<pb n="133" facs="tcp:33686:71"/>gain ſo Conſiderable Succeſſes, and their Power may Encreaſe ſo Plentifully, That when <hi>England</hi> ſhall enter into the League, which all ſorts of Reaſons d'invite it to do, and to Joyn his Forces with the Forces of the Confederates, They would have nevertheleſs Cauſe t' hope for Victory, and ſhould not b' obliged to part with that Willingly, which they could not take from them by Force.</p>
                  <p>Theſe Prejudications, which are Offered, accompanied with many others ſhall be ſet down in the Third Part, may ſuffice to make it appear to our Confederates, what Foundation they can raiſe upon the Duration of particular Treaties, to which th' Houſe of <hi>Auſtria</hi> doth preſs and ſollicit them. And the <hi>Swedes</hi> above all Perſons, whom they would deboſh from the Confederation of <hi>France,</hi> and againſt whoſe Faith they raiſe their ſtrongeſt Batteries, and Arm their ſubtileſt Artifices, are too Dextrous to b' ignorant of the conſtant Reſolution, and immoveable Will of thoſe Princes of that Houſe, not to Suffer them, having advanced their Power ſo far into <hi>Germany,</hi> to take deep Root there, or that ſo Powerfull a Member, and of ſo Warlike a Nation, ſhould b' adjoyned to th' Empire. I believe alſo, that they doubt not, as to what reſpects the Duration and Subſiſtence of the particular Treaty they ſhould have made with them, but that they would find a thouſand Pretences of Honour to break without Diſgrace, and a thouſand Evaſions of Cons;cience to Violate it without Scruple, and that they will bring to their Relief, as hath been in another place Diſcourſed, that Maxim, which they hold ever in Reſerve to make uſe of in time of need, That they are not obliged t' hold Faith with <hi>Heretiques;</hi> Chiefly, when it hath been given in things which help to confirm Hereſie in any Country, from whence they have a deſign to Baniſh it, which furniſh it with Food and Strength, which ſwells and makes it proud with Temporal and other Human advantages for Subſiſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence. That giving them the Reputation of Robbers of the People, and for Raviſhers of Eſtates, as infallibly they will do; They make uſe againſt them of that Opinion of the Caſuiſts, which is derived from the Root of Nature, and whereof th' Heathen have not been ignorant; That promiſes made to Robbers by force, when Men are at their Diſcretion, and the Power is in their Hands, oblige not by Conſequence th' Obſervation of them, and impoſe not a Yoak, which may not be broken without doing Evil.</p>
                  <p>Briefly, they ought t' hold for certain, That the <hi>Spaniards</hi> enjoy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing <hi>Spain,</hi> the fruitfulleſt Mine, and the fulleſt Spring of the Caſes of Conſcience that is in <hi>Chriſtendome;</hi> And being Maſters of the Stock, from whence more abundantly, than from any other place, the ſharp and ſubtil Doctors, who make when they will, ſuch curi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous and exquiſite Anatomies of th' Actions and Manners of Men, and wh' have full Magazines of Colours to diſguiſe things; who decide with a wonderfull Boldneſs, ſuch Difficulties, as the Bible, the Councils, the <hi>Popes,</hi> and the <hi>Fathers</hi> would not touch; And

                  <p>The <hi>Swedes,</hi> I ſay, ought t'hold for certain, That the Princes of that Houſe will ever find ſome of their Doctors (for the ſame Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment is not to be paſt upon all of them) who will maintain, That not t'hold t' Heretiques what hath been promiſed them, is no Evil, when a Good may ariſe from it to Religion; And to ſtrip them of Temporal Goods, which ſerve for Nouriſhment, and A<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

And that it may be ſuch, as is deſired, it muſt be raiſed upon the Baſis of a General Peace; And that a permanent Confederation of them, wh'are aſſociated to make War, be the Buckler of that Peace, and the Rampier to ſecure it, from th'aſſaults that may be made againſt it; It muſt b'alſo the perpetual obſtacle to reſtrain th' Houſe of <hi>Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtria,</hi> and t'hinder it from making Invaſions upon his Neighbours, and to vex it for the future, as it Hath done others for the time paſt.

In like manner, all

                  <p>And it ſeems to me, that the Confederation now on foot between the King and other Princes, who joyn with him to procure a juſt and ſure Peace to the reſt of <hi>Christendome,</hi> hath all the neceſſary Conditions to form and maintain that fair Union and perfect Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſpondency, which we would oppoſe to that which unites and conjoyns th'Houſe of <hi>Auſtria,</hi> and its Dependences. 'Tis what, I pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend to make appear in the following Diſcourſe, and in examining the Nature and the Conditions of the moſt famous Leagues, which <hi>Chriſtendom</hi> hath ſeen for the two laſt Ages, and in diſcovering the Defects and Weakneſſes where they have failed, and which have been the Means of their Diſſolution and Ruine.</p>
                  <p>To diſcourſe then of then Matter, I ſay, That although there are two ſorts of Leagues, or that they may be conſidered under two different Conſiderations, and under two diſtinct Functions; Both of them have need of the ſame Supports for their Eſtabliſhment, and of the ſame Cares for their Duration. There are ſome Leagues which, according to the firſt Intention of them that made them, have no viſible Action in them, nor Motion, nor Life, that is ſenſible, which properly ſignifie no more than to ſecure from apprehended Motions of War, and t'impede turbulent Princes from making of Troubles; As Banks ſtop the Sea from over-flowing, and reſtrain th'Invaſions and Spoils which otherwiſe it would make. Other Leagues are all in Motion, and the firſt Idea under which they're projected, is to ſerve for Remedies againſt th'Evils which preſs, and not againſt them which are feared; To repel the Tempeſts which break forth, and not to cheriſh the Calms that reign. I will give you of both ſome Examples, which ſhall be the Foundations of our Reaſonings, and may render th'Inſtructions to be drawn from it more eaſie and ſenſible. In the time of <hi>Lawrence</hi> of <hi>Medicis,</hi> the greateſt Politician of his Age, a League was formed and flouriſhed, and many other Princes and States of that Country aſſociated to conſerve the publick Peace, and t'Arm unanimouſly againſt him that ſhould firſt diſturb it, and break that ſweet Harmony of the People, which made <hi>Italy</hi> happy.</p>
                  <p>The League had aſpect chiefly upon the <hi>Venetians,</hi> who being then the moſt powerful of all the Princes of <hi>Italy,</hi> were eſteemed alſo the moſt ambitious, and it may be for that reaſon onely, that they were the ſtrongeſt; And that they did not believe, That the Moderation of Deſires, accompani'd willingly with Great Forces, nor that Sobriety could b'obſerved in the Temptation of Abundance.
<pb n="136" facs="tcp:33686:73"/>But the Cement of that League being the wiſdom of <hi>Laurence</hi> of <hi>Medicis,</hi> and that it wanted ſomewhat of more ſtrength and dura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion for its ſubſiſtence; It hapned, that it fell by the death of <hi>Lau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence,</hi> and that <hi>Lodowick Sforza</hi> was the firſt that broke off from it to gain the State of <hi>Milan</hi> from his Nephew, and which opened the Gate by which the <hi>French</hi> entred <hi>Italy,</hi> and after them the <hi>Spaniards,</hi> and the <hi>Germans.</hi> It hapned alſo, as by a juſt Judgment from God, That th'Uſurpator of the State of his Nephew, and the Perturba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor of the Peace of his Country, ſaw himſelf ſtripped of that State, and baniſhed his Country, to paſs the reſt of his days, and die a Priſoner in a Forein Country. That which was to be deſired to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plete that League, and which made it break, was the want of a real and effective great Power to ſupport the weak Pieces of it, which ſhould not have been ſubject to yielding by death, nor of falling by diſgrace, and might ſerve t'all of them for a Haven in time of Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peſt, and for Reſurrection in caſe of Misfortune.</p>
                  <p>But in th'Eſtabliſhment of durable Leagues, and in the collection of Pieces that compoſe it for duration; 'Tis not ſufficient, that a great Power be conjoyned, unleſs the Motions of that Power be Moderate, and have the General Good of the League for its End, to which it ſerves for Chief and Centre. Otherwiſe, if that Supe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riour Power do determine the Ruine of others, and aim at doing Its buſineſs, and not theirs, they will quickly ſever, and ſo ſoon as the great Evil they feared is over, and that the Torrent which gave them trouble is ſtopped, they will withdraw their Contributions, and no longer furniſh Materials, nor lend their Arms to conſtitute a Society, which might in time prove fatal unto them. Let Examples explain our Meaning.</p>
                  <p>When th' Hereſie of <hi>Luther</hi> had taken root in <hi>Germany,</hi> and ſtretched its Branches almoſt over all the North, a League was formed at <hi>Smalchalde</hi> againſt <hi>Charls</hi> the Fifth, of the greateſt part of the Princes and States that had embraced their new Sect; Th'Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perour was conſtrained to form another League to this, and t' im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plore th'aid of Catholique Princes in an occaſion, where th' Antient Religion had cauſe to fear all that could iſſue of ſad and tragical, from the fury and zeal of the new Sects; Some Catholique Princes refuſed to Joyn, as the <hi>Venetians;</hi> Others did Engage, whereof the moſt conſiderable, and who ſent the faireſt and greateſt Army, was th' <hi>Holy Father;</hi> Th' Emperour with this Supply, which was uſeful, and with his Virtue and ordinary Fortune, got the better of th' Aſſociated Proteſtants, and had forced his Victory further into <hi>Germany,</hi> if the Pope, who knew, that <hi>Charls</hi> aimed not at the He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>retiques, but at the Rebels of th'Empire, had not ſtaid his courſe, and withdrawn his Forces, whereby th'Emperour was diſappointed, and ſtood as <hi>Immoveable</hi> in the purſute of his deſigns, as a Ship, when the Wind ſuddenly abates, and is ſurprized with a Calm.</p>
                  <p>Two things are here to b'obſerved, which eſtabliſh and confirm
<pb n="137" facs="tcp:33686:73"/>the Propoſitions propoſed, Th'one, That the Proteſtant League fell by the firſt Blow it received, without riſing again, and one loſt Battel made it vaniſh into ſmoke; for the firſt Reaſon given, and becauſe it wanted ſome great Power that might have rallied the ſcattered Forces; That might have raiſed new Men, and have drawn them together to fight their Enemies, and for other Trials of Fortune. And indeed, to ſpeak truly of the thing, 'Tis the ſame with petty Princes, who make a League againſt a more powerful Prince, as with a Society of Gameſters, wh' are not rich, and having made a Stock, to which every one contributed all the Mony h' had, ſo ſoon as that Money is loſt, are out of countenance, and are conſtrained to break up company, and to retire with their loſs; In like manner, th'others ſetting a foot at firſt all their Forces, and ſtraining to their uttermoſt, being defeated, are without recovery, and disband imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diately, if ſome great Power do not interpoſe to rally them. W' have alſo ſeen the ſame thing happen to the Proteſtant League, which took its beginning from th'incident Troubles between the Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenders to the Succeſſion of <hi>Cleves,</hi> and which diſſolved upon th' oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſion of th'Election of the Count Palatine to the Kingdom of <hi>Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hemia;</hi> The firſt great Blow that was given became mortal to't; And it was ſo aſtoniſhed at the loſs of the Battel of <hi>Prague,</hi> that it could never recover its ſtrength again; And all that the King of <hi>Denmark, Halberstat,</hi> and <hi>Mansfielt</hi> have ſince done, to re-inforce that Party, have ſerved onely to make it languiſh the longer, and reſembled the precious Waters are given to deſperate ſick perſons, which make th'Heart a little to recover, and prolong the life ſome few howers, but reſtore not health, and prevent not death.</p>
                  <p>Th'other thing to be conſidered in the Catholique League, which ſubdued the Proteſtants, is, That it held indeed of great Powers, and that it had for Foundation and Ligament a great Emperour, who made th' Eagles of th'Empire fly higher than they'd done ſince <hi>Charlemain</hi>'s time. But being more Ambitious than Powerful, He carried not falſly that Embleme which diſcovered th'Immenſity of his Deſires,
<q>Never to ſtop, but to paſs always further.</q> For without reſpect to the good of his Confederates, He ſtudied onely his Particular profit; That was the cauſe, as hath been ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved, that they retired from the League. The ſame Emperor en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavoured, after the re-eſtabliſhment of <hi>Sforces</hi> in the State of <hi>Milan,</hi> to form in <hi>Italy</hi> another League of the firſt ſort, under pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence of employing it againſt the <hi>French</hi> irruptions that ſhould un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dertake to trouble their Peace, and to draw thither to raiſe Quarrels; or to make uſe of them againſt the <hi>Turk,</hi> if his Fleets aſſaulted the States of any of the Confederates, and Infeſted their Shoars. But th'<hi>Italians</hi> were as Cautious as he was ſubtil, and diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covering
<pb n="138" facs="tcp:33686:74"/>th' Hook he did caſt into ſo ſpecious a Bit, They would not be taken with it. For it was very viſible to them, That th'Emperor aimed from thence to confirm his Power in <hi>Italy,</hi> which the <hi>French</hi> alone were able to ſhake; And in holding the <hi>Turk</hi> at Bay, to labour with more eaſe and leſs oppoſition the ruine of <hi>Chriſtians.</hi> The <hi>Germans</hi> were not ſo well adviſed and wiſe, when they formed that League of <hi>Suaube,</hi> which ſerved ſo long to do th' Affairs of th'Houſe of <hi>Auſtria,</hi> and t'advance their Greatneſs, under colour of ſuppreſſing the Rebells of th'Empire, and the Diſturbers of the Peace of <hi>Germany;</hi> It had not ſtaid there, and th'Ill which it did, believing to do well, had not ſo ſoon ceaſed, if it had not been diſſipated by th'Endeavours of <hi>Francis</hi> the Firſt, and by th'Induſtry and Eloquence of <hi>Sir</hi> of <hi>Langey,</hi> who made the <hi>Dutch</hi> to comprehend th'<hi>Auſtrian</hi> Artifices, and laid open the Stratagems that were on foot by that Family to deſtroy them.</p>
                  <p>In the precedent Diſcourſe, I've given you the platform of that League, which <hi>Philip</hi> the Second endeavoured to make with the <hi>Pope</hi> and with the <hi>Venetians,</hi> after the <hi>Selim</hi> the Second had aſſaulted <hi>Cyprus,</hi> and that the noiſe of th'<hi>Ottoman</hi>'s Arms, with the conſterna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion and fear of them, had flown about <hi>Italy.</hi> We've alſo there ſeen the Reſiſtance made by the <hi>Pope</hi> and the <hi>Venetians,</hi> to the propoſals of that Prince, which breathed onely his particular Intereſt. And we ſhall ſee in the Third Part the ſmall ſatisfaction that the <hi>Venetians</hi> drew from that League, which was concluded with him, and that at laſt they were conſtrained to make a ſeparate Accord with the <hi>Turk,</hi> and without the privity of <hi>Philip,</hi> as many years before they'd been obliged to buy their peace of <hi>Soliman,</hi> after that the proceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings of <hi>Charls</hi> the Fifth, with whom they were in League, gave them occaſion to know, That they could not continue the War in ſo ill Company, and in ſo unfaithful a Society, without running th'hazard to Ruine. It hath not been dangerous onely to make Leagues with <hi>Charls</hi> the Fifth, and with <hi>Philip</hi> his Son; Th' Evil came from a higher Line, and the Corruption hath a higher Spring; <hi>Ferdinand</hi> of <hi>Arragon</hi> their Grandfather tranſmitted unto them with his Blood, that too much intereſſed Inclination; As he was one of them who broke the League of <hi>Cambray,</hi> to the prejudice of <hi>Lewis</hi> the Twelfth, who had ſo Legally obſerved it; And the League he made at <hi>Blois</hi> was to ſtrip the King of <hi>Naples</hi> his Kinſman, of his Inheritance, and for the full Conqueſt of his Kingdom. And after he had gained by the Valour of the Great Captain, what did be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>long t' his Partition, he cauſed us to be vexed, and made ſtudied Quarrels to take away the Partition that did belong to us; By th' In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vincible Habit th'Houſe of <hi>Austria</hi> hath acquired not t'obſerve, what it hath promiſed; And from their ſubtil Art to diſpoſe the Leagues where it Enters, to its particular Ends, without reſpect of the Good of th'other Confederates. In that of <hi>Germany,</hi> which ſubſiſted under the name of Catholique; In apparence, it avoided the direction of
<pb n="139" facs="tcp:33686:74"/>that Army t<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>abate the Jealouſie of the Confederates, and that the Forces of that League were put into th'hands of the Duke of <hi>Bava<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ria,</hi> a Prince of another Houſe, and under the Count of <hi>Tilly,</hi> a Lieutenant General, which depended upon him. But in this there was but a Tranſpoſtion of Colours, whilſt the Things were the ſame; And th'Emperour gained that by a by-way, which he could not obtain by a ſtreight; whilſt the Forces of that League held the Proteſtant Arms at a Bay, and hindred all that they could undertake againſt the Catholiques; Hereſolved to raiſe others in his own Name, and under General <hi>Walleſtine,</hi> that had dependency and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation onely upon himſelf; Th' Emperor with theſe Forces, which made themſelves formidable and prodigious by th' inventions of Quarters, which this great General gave to th'Officers to make their Levies, began to give the Law t'all <hi>Germany,</hi> and threatned all that was independent and free; And when th'Affair of <hi>Mantoua</hi> hapned, it appeared then certainly to the Catholiques, that it was not ſo much to the Religion of the Proteſtants that th' Emperor made War, as to their Eſtates; And the Peace he made with the King of <hi>Denmark,</hi> t'intend th'oppreſſion of the Duke of <hi>Mantoua,</hi> made them underſtand, That if the progreſs of the Arms was not ſtopped, Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholiques and Proteſtants ſhould be concerned in the ſame Miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chief; And that they had not begun t'act by the ruine of th'one, but for to finiſh, by the ruine of th'others. The deſcent then into <hi>Italy</hi> of th'Emperours beſt Forces, under the Conduct of <hi>Coſalto,</hi> and the condition <hi>Germany</hi> found it ſelf in from thence to be diſcharged of that burthen of Soldiers which oppreſſed it, gave courage to the Duke of <hi>Bavaria</hi> and his Party, to ſpeak high at the Diet of <hi>Ratisbon,</hi> in favour of the <hi>German</hi> Liberty, and then to demand the Degrada<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of <hi>Walſthein,</hi> who was the Flayl, and the moſt proper Inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment th'Emperour could have found t'impoſe ſervitude on <hi>Germany.</hi> The <hi>Spaniards</hi> also, to whom the fierce and indocile humour of <hi>Walleſthein</hi> was odious, and who looked upon him as the greateſt Obſtacle they could have encountred upon the way they had made plain, for the re-uniting of th'Empire to their Branch, thruſt ſtoutly at the Wheel the Duke of <hi>Bavaria</hi> had ſet a going. The Proteſtants on th'other ſide, who had been plundred, or believed that they ſhould be plundred, and to whom th'exorbitant Contributions, which <hi>Walleſthein</hi> had raiſed on their Eſtates, were as fore-runners and preſages of their approaching ruine, Treated with the King of <hi>Swede</hi> to come to the relief of their dying Liberty, and to make uſe of the Conjuncture of the diſarming of <hi>Walleſthein,</hi> and of the Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cenſing of his Troops, who demanded but ſafe retrait and protection againſt the Commiſſions which were t'iſſue t'enquire of the Spoils his Soldiers had committed upon the Lands of th' Empire. And ſo the Catholique Princes breathed away the fear th'Houſe of <hi>Auſtria</hi> gave them, and were aſſaulted with a greater and more dangerous fear, raiſed from the <hi>Swediſh</hi> Victories. But if that Evil had not pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceded, the Remedy had not followed; And if the Deſigns of that
<pb n="140" facs="tcp:33686:75"/>Houſe had been moderate, th' Arms of that Prince had never entred into <hi>Germany,</hi> and that Houſe had not tried the ſame Lot it made other ſuffer.</p>
                  <p>As to the League made between the King of <hi>Swede,</hi> and the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſtants who called him to their Relief, It cannot truly be ſaid, that the King of <hi>Swede</hi> was one of the great Powers, whereof we ſpeak, if they are conſidered by the fertility and riches of their Country, By the Multitude of their Subjects, and by other Advantages, which are rather faſtned to the Domination, than to the Perſon of Princes. But this Prince had ſuch admirable Conditions in his Perſon, and ſuch a collection of natural and acquired Virtues, that the quickly put himſelf into the poſture of being that great Power, whereunto the Powers of the League were ſubaltern and dependent. At firſt they caſt their eyes upon him through Jealouſie had of their Country<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men, and gave not th'Honour t' one of their Nation, but made the King of <hi>Swede</hi> chief of the <hi>League;</hi> Or they thought, it may be, none of courage and underſtanding enough to bear the weight of that War; And judged alſo, That the King of <hi>Swede</hi> being in ſome ſort under their pay, they might diſpoſe of him as they pleaſed, and might retain him juſtly to the neceſſary Conſiderations, for the ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſing of th'Ambitious Deſigns of th'Emperour, and to reſtore to th'Empire its loſt Peace, and its antient Privileges. But they were not well adviſed; for that Prince was ſo brave, and ſo full of cou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rage, that he could not act ſuch a perſon; And as a Torrent is not to be ſtopped at pleaſure, which the force of diſſolved Snows forceth from a Mountain, nor a great Fire eaſily put out, which the Wind blows, and is faſtned t' a great quantity of combuſtible Matters; So this Prince rendred himſelf ſo powerful and ſo formidable, by the Victories which crowded upon him; For his Conqueſts were th' Adamants which drew others unto them; that many of the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>federates before his death had him in great jealouſie. But let's leave there thoſe Apprehenſions, the ſuſpition of an Evil which did not happen, to ſpeak of that which concerns us. 'Tis eaſie to judge by what hath been ſaid, That the League which is now of foot between us and our Confederates, hath all neceſſary Conditions for Conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuation of the War, ſo long as it may be uſeful, and to make the Peace that muſt determine it Sacred and Inviolable. This great Power, whereof it hath been ſpoken, is there to be found, which hath not onely the right of Birth before all other Powers of <hi>Chriſtendom,</hi> by th' Antiquity of its Original, but hath it alſo by the greatneſs of its Forces, and by'n abundance of Mony and Men, which reſembles not to the Waters of Ciſterns, which are eaſily drawn off, but to them that iſſue from living Springs, which refreſh and renew them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves as they run off. This Truth is ſo certain, and of an Experience ſo general and ſo confirmed, that to b'ignorant of it is not to be of the world, or to know any thing of what paſſeth in it. 'Tis, not to know that w'have done in <hi>Italy</hi> in favour of the Duke of <hi>Mantoua;</hi> And not t' have underſtood, that notwithſtanding the fearful diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culties
<pb n="141" facs="tcp:33686:75"/>which accompani'd that War; The Deſolation which the Plague and Famine had made in our Armies, and the Diſgraces hapned t' our Allies by their ill fortune, or by their fault; We forced <hi>Germany, Spain,</hi> and <hi>Savoy</hi> aſſociated, to reſtore what they had uſurped, and to re-eſtabliſh the Duke of <hi>Mantoua</hi> and the <hi>Griſons</hi> in their Eſtates and Gariſons; 'Tis to b' ignorant what the King did for the <hi>Swediſh</hi> Party, and for his Confederates, ſince the Battel of <hi>Nortlinghen;</hi> What he daily doth in <hi>Germany,</hi> in the <hi>Low-Countries,</hi> in <hi>Italy,</hi> and in <hi>Spain;</hi> The Money and Men which he ſent thither, and the number of his Armies by Sea and by Land, which filled our Enemies with fear, and all <hi>Europe</hi> with aſtoniſhment.</p>
                  <p>As to the ſecond Condition, The Moderation of Deſires, and that fair Temperance, which puts a Bridle into the mouth of Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bition, and ties up Courage, which th'<hi>Heroes</hi> are more troubled t'obſerve, than to defeat Armies, and to tame Monſters, It cannot alſo be denied, that 'tis the more admirable in the Kings Soul, that having all the Lights which enlighten the Cabinet, and all Qualities that are active in the Field, He hath beſides theſe, the Forces of a great Kingdom to put them in Motion; He hath all that's neceſſary for Invading, and for Uſurping, if he did not believe, That 'tis more Magnanimous and more Glorious, to conſerve and to defend; Some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what more divine t' exerciſe Juſtice, than to make Conqueſts.</p>
                  <p>I have ſowed ſo many proofs of this Truth in ſo many places of this Book, that I conceive it a ſuperfluous thing to repeat them, and repoint to the eye of the Reader the ſame Figures. However, I do beſeech him to remember, that in the long and tragical actions which vex <hi>Christendom,</hi> the King never began t'any perſon, and that he ſtirred not, nor engaged, but to relieve his Friends, which were oppreſſed, and t'abate the Deſigns which would have conſumed their Eſtates. That he never took Arms till he had tried the ways of ſweetneſs; and of good Endeavours; That before he paſſed th' <hi>Alps</hi> for the delivery of <hi>Caſal,</hi> which <hi>Gonſailes</hi> had beſieged, he ſent into <hi>Spain;</hi> He cauſed Endeavours to b' uſed at <hi>Vienna;</hi> He prevailed with the Pope t' interpoſe his Authority t' oblige the <hi>Spaniards</hi> to retire, and with honour, their Arms from <hi>Montferrat;</hi> As before the beginning of the War he commanded a Treaty with the Duke of <hi>Savoy</hi> by ſeveral Agents, and with moſt advantagious Offers, that could be deſired, if he could admit of equitable ones, to compoſe civilly the differences h' had with the Duke of <hi>Mantoua;</hi> And after h' had raiſed the Siege of <hi>C<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap>ſal</hi> in forcing th' <hi>Alps,</hi> and had given peace to the <hi>Spaniards,</hi> which was ſo neceſſary for them, He ſent to <hi>Vienna</hi> t' hinder them from being perjured, and to divert the Seeds of a ſecond War, in cauſing to be delivered to the Duke of <hi>Mantoua</hi> th'Inveſtitures promiſed by the Peace of <hi>Suza.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>As to <hi>Germany,</hi> all the world knows that the King did not for pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent interpoſe in the Troubles that have vexed them, but t'appeaſe them; And that in the Quarel of th' Emperour and the Count <hi>Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>latine</hi> for the Kingdom of <hi>Bohemia,</hi> he ſent a famous Embaſſage to

Since that time th'Affairs of th' Empire being raiſed to a prodigious Succeſs, and the King obſerving, that the Treaties of <hi>Ratisbon</hi> and of <hi>Cairaſque</hi> had not ſhut up all the Winds, which might trouble the third time the Tranquillity of <hi>Italy,</hi> and carry the Storm further, if th'Houſe of <hi>Auſtria</hi> had nothing to do 'n <hi>Germany.</hi> He cauſed a Treaty to be made with the King of <hi>Swede,</hi> whom the Proteſtants had called into <hi>Germany,</hi> and furniſhed him with ſome Money, to give him the better means to give Employment and Exerciſe to that Houſe, that it might no longer think of giving trouble t'his Allies, nor t' himſelf in his Kingdom. To conclude, h'had never declared a War to <hi>S<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  <p>In the ſecond place, t'aſſure the world that the King's Arms are not mercenary, nor moved by the ſpirit of Particular Intereſt, let the laſt Treaty be remembred which he made with the Duke of <hi>Cleves,</hi> and the generoſity, wherewith he renounced, in favour of the Duke, one of the Juſteſt Conqueſts which could ariſe from the right of War. Be't remembred, how freely h' abandoned by the Treaty of <hi>Cairaſque</hi> almoſt all <hi>Savoy,</hi> and a part of <hi>Piedmont,</hi> which h' had lawfully gained, to cauſe <hi>Mantoua</hi> to be rendred, which was but a coloured Uſurpation, and the Country of the <hi>Griſons,</hi> which was an Uſurpation without colour. That if it appears the King and ſome Gariſons of th'Empire in his hands, the number whereof is very ſmall, or ſome others of his Allies in <hi>Italy,</hi> It muſt be conſidered, that 'tis onely to keep them for the Owners, wh' are not able to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fend them, which to the King is matter onely of great Expence; or to free his Frontiers from the Jealouſie they would, receive from them, if they fell into th'hands of his Enemies; or to ſerve for a Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trait or ſafety t'his Armies, when they're obliged to march far for the good of the common Cauſe; Or laſtly, to ſacrifize them to the good of the ſame Cauſe, and to the re-eſtabliſhment of his ſtript Friends in the Treaty of a General Peace.</p>
                  <p>That if <hi>Pignerol</hi> remain in the King's power after the Wars of <hi>Italy,</hi> which have preceded the Peace of <hi>Cairaſque;</hi> And if that place ſeems to be the recompenſe of ſo many thouſands of the Kings dead Subjects, and of ſo many millions of Money, ſpent for the Liberty of that Country; 'Tis a thing, in my opinion, which cannot reaſona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly be reproached unto him, nor envied; ſince he doth not keep it as a Conqueſt, but as an Acquiſition, and that he hath bought it with the good-will of him, wh' had power to ſell it; ſince it was not done ſo much of ſerve for Rampart t'his Kingdom, and to ſecure the Frontiers, as t'have a free Entry int' <hi>Italy,</hi> and to make the more haſte to its Relief, when it ſhould b'aſſaulted. Let the Diſintereſt and
<pb n="143" facs="tcp:33686:76"/>Magnanimity be conſidered, which have appeared in all the Treaties on the Kings part made in <hi>Germany,</hi> ſince that which <hi>Sir</hi> of <hi>Charnaſé</hi> made at <hi>Beerwalde;</hi> And that which <hi>Sir</hi> of <hi>Avaux</hi> renewed the laſt year at <hi>Hambrough.</hi> Let the ſweetneſs and equity of the Conditions be conſidered, wherewith he received into protection th'Elector of <hi>Ireves,</hi> as may be ſeen in the Treaties made with him by the <hi>Sirs</hi> of St. <hi>Chaumont</hi> and of <hi>Saludie;</hi> Let the cares had of the <hi>Swediſh</hi> Inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſt be conſidered, and th'effective and real Acknowledgments which the <hi>Swediſh</hi> King always exhorted His Confederates to pay the King, as may be juſtifi'd by the Orations which <hi>Sir</hi> of <hi>Feuquieres</hi> made to th'Aſſembly of <hi>Hailbrun</hi> and <hi>Franckford.</hi> Let Conſequences at laſt be drawn out of the like Actions from the Kings Promiſes to the Princes of <hi>Italy,</hi> concerning the places h' holds in <hi>Piedmont,</hi> and which he confirms in this manner, in the third Article of the Treaty he made with <hi>Sirs</hi> the Princes of <hi>Savoy. That the King newly ratifies the Declarations which have been made by his Ambaſſadors in divers Ot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cafions, and by the Letters his Mejesty hath written to the Pope, and to the Republique of</hi> Venice, <hi>upon the reſtitution of the Places which his Majesty holds in</hi> Piedmont, <hi>ſince the death of the late</hi> Sir Victor <hi>of</hi> Amedeé <hi>Provided, that ſuch Places as are held by the</hi> Spaniards <hi>his Enemies, be reciprocally reſtored, and that</hi> Sir <hi>the Duke of</hi> Savoy <hi>remain certainly the Maſter of them, under the Tuition and Regency of Madame.</hi> Let the conſequence of this, I ſay, be taken into conſideration, and it will appear, that our Confederates may take a full and entire con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fidence in this Conduct; And that the <hi>Counſellour</hi> of th' <hi>Elector</hi> of <hi>Mayence,</hi> above all queſtion a very able Man, in the Dyet held ſome months paſt at <hi>Mayence,</hi> believing to decipher the Kings Deſigns t'eſtabliſh himſelf in <hi>Germany,</hi> deviated from the Truth, though it was by way of probability, and that he diſcovered effectively the Means, wherewith he might do it, if he had had the Will.</p>
                  <p>Before this Diſcourſe b'ended, the <hi>Reader</hi> is to b' adviſed, That I had finiſhed two Treaties which are of the Subject I handle in theſe two Books; Th'one of the Nature of Equivocations; Th'other, of the force of Opinions, which are of great importance for Miniſters of State to know. But inſomuch that this Book is already too long, and that theſe two Treaties may enter commodiouſly into the Third Part, I have believed it was moſt convenient to place them there.</p>

                  <head type="sub">That the true Exerciſe of the Magnanimity of a Prince Conſiſts in Secu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring his Countrey from Civil Wars, and in Diverting of Forein Wars; That the King hath Admirably Proſpered in theſe two Things.</head>
                  <p>'<seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>Is certain, That the true exerciſe of the Magna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nimity of a Prince, and the Juſt handling of his Arms, Conſiſts onely in theſe two things, Th' one in quieting of his Countrey, when it is a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gitated, and in Cutting up the Roots, and ſtop<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ping of the Springs of the Troubles, which may there ariſe; Th'other in defeating th' Enterpr<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zes, which ſtrangers may ſet on foot againſt him, or his Allies, and in Confining Ambition, within the Bounds of Juſtice: When He hath gained theſe two Ends, and that theſe great Concluſions have proſpered with him; He may ſay, that nothing is wanting to his glory; That his Life hath nothing more in deſire to become th'Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample of Princes and th'Admiration of the people; And ſuch a proſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perity is th'ultimate proof of the Love of Heaven, and the moſt won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derful effect that Virtue can produce.</p>
                  <p>'Tis not truly to be denied, but that the Kings Reign is very ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervable
<pb n="145" facs="tcp:33686:77"/>by theſe two wonders; That h' hath effaced the glory of the faireſt precedent Reigns, and hath not leſt to ſubſequent Generations, Matter for Equality, nor any thing to Mow, the whole Crop being carried away; As to the firſt point, which reſpects th'inſide of the Countrey, and th'obedience which Subjects owe their Pricne, who knows not that is was ſo looſe amongſt us, That very often it was entirely divolved into th' <hi>Hugonots,</hi> and that it was not rendred ſo Pure or ſo Neat, as it ought t' have been, from the greateſt part of Catholiques? <hi>France</hi> was a horrid Spectacle, and a Monſtrous Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſion; for in the midſt of the State, another State was to be ſeen, where a confirmed Faction did Reign, which was maintained at the Charges of the Prince, and became Rich by his Wealth; To whom leaving places of Security, It was a Tacit Declaration to the world, that their faith, which ought to b' as firm and Immoveable, as the Poles of Heaven, and Foundations of th'Earth, was doubted and fuſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pected; Where there was n' other diſcourſe than of Aſſemblies, of Circles, of Abreges of Circles, of Chiefs of Parties, and of the like Denominations of ill Augury, which were th' Evidences of a pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent and future revolt. How juſt a thing then, and how neceſſary was it, that ſuch a Faction ſhould be ſuppreſſed, and that they wh' had a common Birth, and drew the ſame Air, and reſted under the cares of the ſame Prince, and under the Protection of the ſame Laws, ſhould be reduced t'equal Subjection, and Pay a common Obedience to the Power that Protected them? It Queſtion be made of this, Let the ſame Faction now Live, and the ſame Inſurrections and Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>olences Aſſault us.</p>
                  <p>But as this was very Juſt, ſo it was very Difficult; And if it were th'Effect of an ordinary Addreſs, and of a Mean force to deſtroy ſo bold and opinionate a Rebellion, and to Remit to their Natural places, the parts torn from their Head and from the reſt of the Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy, as were ſome of this Nation; <hi>Philip the ſecond</hi> and his Succeſſors have made Experiment of it, in the Defection of the <hi>Low Countreys.</hi> And truly a Party, as that of th' <hi>Hugonots,</hi> Rooted in ſo many places of this Kingdome; Animated to its Defence by Religion, the moſt Violent and undaunted Motive that can provoke the Spirit of Man; Proud and fierce, not only by the Conſideration of Effective Advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tages, and preſent Forces, but alſo by the Memory of the Loſſes from which it was relieved, and of the Weakneſſe from which it was Reſtored; A Party, I ſay, ſuch as that, ſtrengthned with three hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred places, whereof ſome were ſtrong; Aided by many Chiefs of Repute and Merit, and ſupported by a great Forein Power, was viſibly Invincible.</p>
                  <p>In effect, It could not have been overcome, but by ſuch a Warlike Prince as ours, wh'had the Courage t'undertake all that was not Impoſſible, if it was neceſſary; The Prudence to Conduct that great Deſign, and to diſunite them, whom it head not been ſafe t'have Aſſaulted, Joyned and united; T'apply gentl Remedies, where vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent
<pb n="146" facs="tcp:33686:78"/>had been dangerous, and to Move by perſwaſion and Addreſſe, where it was difficult to prevail by force, and Conſtraint; wh' had reſolution to force the buſineſſe to the Wall, and not to ſtop on th' Half way, as it had been often done, nor to retire by reaſon of the length of Time, or Difficulty of the Work, nor for the ſecret Contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dictions of his Counſellors, nor for th'open Oppoſitions his Enemies would make him, nor for the Reſiſtance He might Encounter in th' Elements, nor for the contrary Alterations, the ſtarrs might raiſe a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt Him; Wh' had a ſtrong Piety t' attract the favour of Heaven upon his Enterprizes, and t'Invite them to deſcend upon his Armies, without which, all the powers of Men are Impotent, and all their Deſigns Barren. To declare now, what Fruits we've gathered from the Ruine of this Party, and what the benefit of them ſhall be, which are yet unripe, and cannot long be ripening. No perſon can truly doubt, but that the firſt fruits are very great, unleſs it be thougt a ſmall thing, That the King hath recovered this Party to the Sove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raignty, which his Father could not leave him, and his Predeceſſors had loſt; That He is become Maſter of all his Subjects, and Poſſeſſor of all his Kingdome; That his Countrey, which diviſion rendred weak and open to many Injuries, hath reaſſumed its forces, and repaired its breaches, by th'Union and Concord of its Inhabitants; That the moſt culpable have no places of Refuge for their faults, nor the moſt diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>contented any Retrait, where they may Meditate and form Rebelli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons in ſafety; That by this, the King, in Imitation of God, hath drawn Good from Evill, and ſo ſtrongly reunited them t' his ſervice who had given him Troubles, that they've ſince laboured profitably in his Deſigns, and Aided Joyntly with the reſt of his Subjects to gain him Victories, and to prepare Triumphs for him; That by this Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral and profound peace, which h' hath eſtabliſhed in his King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome, H' hath been more ſafe and free to march abroad, to quenon the fire that burnt his Allies, and to break th' Irons were forged for <hi>Italy,</hi> and for <hi>Germany.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>As to the good, which the future Time doth provide for us, as one of th' Happy Conſequences of the ſuppreſſion of th' <hi>Hugonot</hi> party, We cannot indeed Relliſh it ſufficiently, whilſt the Miſeries of the Want do afflict us, and Peace onely can make us truly ſenſible of it. 'Tis then we ſhall know by Experience that the King hath no other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe done in the Levy of Moneys, and in the ſubventions, which the neceſſity of his Affairs forced him to draw from his people, but as a good Father of a Family, who doth not demoliſh any part of his Houſe, but to make it better than it was, and of a fairer Structure; The bounties wherewith he deſires, though to this day he cannot per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form it, to gratifie his Subjects, Reſemble to certain Rivers, which be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing hid for ſome time in th'Earth, break not out, but never to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn, and to Run alwaies upon its ſurface. The time of this favou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable Change, and of this profitable Revolution, is very near; The Clemency of God is ready to diſarm his Juſtice, and to take out of
<pb n="147" facs="tcp:33686:78"/>her hands the Flayl wherewith h' hath beaten us for ſo many years. All the cauſes of our Expence ceaſe with the War; Peace, which never comes into the World, but Crowned with Abundance, and hands full of Riches, will iſſue ſhortly from the midſt of this Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſion, and from the Chaos, wherein <hi>Chriſtendome</hi> is plunged. It ſhall not be a Peace of Glaſs, as many others which have been ſeen, but a Peace of Diamond, which ſhall have beauty and ſolidiy; And the foundations, which the King makes and layes in all places, ſhall be ſo deep and large, ſo entire and ſound, that of a long time, a fault is not to be feared.</p>
                  <p>It hath not failed truly on this part, but that It had been Accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pliſhed; And the Moneys He hath advanced, and the things h' hath quitted upon that Accompt are a ſufficient Evidence to <hi>Chriſtendome,</hi> that nothing is ſo dear to him as the Repoſe of it. The paſſion h' hath for Peace, will Triumph at laſt over th' Inclination of th'Houſe of <hi>Austria</hi> for War: Though it cannot be ſtronger or more obſtinate than it hath of late appeared; 'Tis not nevertheleſs Invincible, and the great Engine that ſuſteined it, whoſe wheel was even in Motion in this Countrey, being ſtopped, and th'Hopes, which do yet Nou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſh and give it a little Life, which is <hi>Germany,</hi> being of ſhort Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinuance, It muſt of Neceſſty ſhortly fall and be deſtroyed. And though the King had Power and Means t' overcome, and to make more Conqueſts than that Houſe hath t'Engage and Loſe; He ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver had a greater deſire to lay down Arms than at this time, and th' Higher he is in Proſperity, the Readier to deſcend for the General Good, and the ſtronger and more Impetuous the Current is of his Victories, the more he's diſpoſed to ſtop it for publique benefit. By virtue of his Magnanimity, he will do more than all the forces of his Enemies can conſtrain him to do, all will render Generouſly, what will b' Impoſſible to take from him. Nevertheleſs t'induce the <hi>German</hi> Circles to furniſh them with Money to Compel us t'hearken to Peace, whereunto by their Report w' are adverſe, they fail not to publiſh in all places, That the Treaty of <hi>Hamborough</hi> was not ſtaid by them, nor the Peace of <hi>Chriſtendome.</hi> But the contrary is ſo fully de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clared in <hi>Germany,</hi> The King of <hi>Denmark</hi> hath ſo cleerly underſtood it, and th' Ambaſſadours of Newtral Princes Reſident in the Court of the King of <hi>Hungary,</hi> have expreſſed it in ſuch certain and poſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive Tearms, that there's not a Perſon, wh' hath not diſcovered the Deceit and the Deſign.</p>
                  <p>As to the ſecond point; 'tis certainly much advanced, if not effected, and all their Apparences will prove falſe; for the King by th' Aids of his Confederates, will deſtroy in the Souls of the Princes of th'Houſe of <hi>Austria,</hi> and eſpecially in that of the <hi>Spaniards</hi> where its principal Seat is, the Deſign of th'Univerſal Monarchy, whereof they're Accuſed, and that Eminent Crime imputed to them, which hath been the Spring of ſo many Troubles and Diſorders. And 'tis that, which will make the Reign of the King, Remarkable and Glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious
<pb n="148" facs="tcp:33686:79"/>above the Reigns of all his Predeceſſors, and will be the Cauſe, that <hi>Chriſtendome</hi> have an Immortal Obligation to him for hindering that Proud <hi>Houſe,</hi> that had Devoured it in Thought, t' Advance one pace towards that End, or to take any Meaſure thereof that hath not been Broken. But that no Perſon may ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe that I d' Offer at this by Chance, and that ſpeaking of the deſign of this pretended Monarchy, I make a Monſter of my Self in the Conteſt; I am reſolved here to Lay out ſome Pieces, and to give you a Part of the Platform framed in <hi>Spain,</hi> as well as it hath been Underſtood; others may make up what ſhall be wanting to Compleat the Diſcovery, and Finſish the Painting, whereof you ſhall receive now only the firſt Draught. I will take this Deſign from its firſt Original, and from the moſt Concealed Spring, and Continue it to the Troubles of <hi>Bohemia,</hi> where it appeared moſt Evidently, and broke out with greater Light, Noiſe, and Violence, than it had done before; for tis true, That the firſt Motion of Defection or Revolt, call it what you pleaſe, raiſed in the Minds of the <hi>Bohemians</hi> againſt th' Houſe of <hi>Auſtria,</hi> and the firſt Thoughts they had to withdraw themſelves from that Power, and to ſubmit t' another Yoak, proceeded from the fear they had to fall in Time under the <hi>Spaniſh</hi> Domination. The Love of Liberty, wherewith the Northern people are more taken than any people of the World, made them Apprehend the Death of their Liberty, wounded in many places by a Power, which alwayes holds Strangers by ſuch Charms, as they cannot break; And is never Confident of their Faith, but by th' Impotency wherein they are Caſt, not to Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bell.</p>
                  <p>On th' other ſide, the Zeal of Religion, which is equally Violent, whether Good or Bad, in all them that have it, ſuffered them not to make a Repreſentation of that ſevere Tribunal without horrour and deſpair, which in permitting them but one Religion, hath Sword and Fire to Root up and to Deſtroy all others. From theſe two undaunted Paſſions did Grow and Bud, as the Fruits of that Seed, and the Bows of that Tree, that memorable Riſing, which they made againſt th' Emperour <hi>Ferdinand,</hi> and their fatal Election to the Kingdome of <hi>Bohemia,</hi> which they fixed in the Perſon of <hi>Fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derick Count Palatine.</hi> It ſhall be made t' appear at th' End of this Book by Authentique proofs, That his Judgement of the <hi>Bohemians</hi> was not Vain, not their fear Panique; And that the <hi>Spaniards</hi> had of a long time forged that Project, That they did daily lay the Foundations, and brought Materials to Continue it, and to Cheriſh it to the Rearing. As to what is of the ſequel of Defection, which is not yet Finiſhed, and the Troubles it hath cauſed in <hi>Europe,</hi> which are not yet Ceaſed, It hath been ſpoken of in many places of this Work, and it ſhall more fully be ſpoken of in the Third Part, where I hope to make 't appear, That whether th' Hiſtory b' Ancient or Modern, Theres not a Mapp to be found, where
<pb n="149" facs="tcp:33686:79"/>more Rapid and more changeable Paſſions are to be ſeen from Men, more ſuddain and unexpected Stroaks from Fortune, and more fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mous Occurrences, and of greater Inſtruction for Princes than thoſe that hapned in th' Affairs of <hi>Germany.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Before th' handling of this important Matter, and Entring into ſo fair a Field, I cannot hold from Speaking a few Words of the Deportments of a part of them whom th' Houſe of <hi>Auſtria</hi> imploy to make War, and of the wayes they take t' aſſure their Conqueſts. Theſe men then whom we've often in hand, and from whom w' have been ſometimes Troubled to defend our Frontiers, Are a cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain race of Men, in whom the Vicinity and Commerce of the <hi>Turks,</hi> whereof their Troops are made up, have made loſe all Senſe of Humanity, and of Religion; And that th' Impurity of their Crimes, which they received inſtead of Pay, had begot an Invincible habit in th' Exerciſe of all manner of Cruelties, and in Committing all ſorts of Sacrileges.

                  <p>As to them, in whoſe favour theſe Tragical and ſad Conqueſts are made, 'Tis certain, That if they beat down or deſtroy and thing of a Country, 'Tis ſo far from being their Deſign, as '<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">

And inſomuch, that they well know, that many Generations muſt paſs, and many Ages ſlide away, before the Conquered people forgetting their firſt Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mination under which they Lived, b' Accuſtomed to the New, and that forced Obedience, and ſuch as is not in their power to Refuſe, agrees better with their Proud and Imperious Humour, than Volun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tary Obedience, which may be loſt, as often as Subjects change their Affections, and gain New Maſters; They ſecure them by Garriſons and Colonies, and by the Power of Governments and Magiſtrates, which they put into th' Hands of their Country-men, with Excluſion to ſtrangers, and by that means are Puniſhed for the Vices of their Birth, and make Repentance for Sins, whereof they are not Guilty.</p>

And 'tis the Deſolation the King would prevent, before it grow Dangerous, and bear even upon the Heart of his Affairs; 'Tis the Tempeſt that he would allay before it break forth; 'Tis the true cauſe of the Relief, he requires from his People, and the Reaſon that compells him to ſet on foot that hard and ſad Law of Conſervation, which permits the Diver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion and Averſion of the greater, by the leſſer Evils.</p>

And though th' Ambition of his Son-in-Law gave him much perſonal Trouble, and was the Diſturbance of his Reſt, and Torment of his Age; it might b' Endured with the ſame ſenſe, That <hi>Agrippina</hi> Mother of <hi>Nero,</hi> did th' Advice of an Aſtronomer, who threatned with the Sad and Tragical Entertainment her Son would give her if he came to th' Empire, Anſwered; <hi>Let me Dye, provided that he may Reign.</hi>

                  <p>Lets make a Halt here, that ſhall not be unprofitable, and Conſider before we go on, what the Poſſeſſion of th' Empire may Contribute to the deſign of the Monarchy. 'Tis certain, that as, amongſt the ſecular Dignities of <hi>Chriſtendome,</hi> There's none ſo High, or whoſe Light ſhines ſo Lively as th' Imporial; It hath alſo Extraordinary Means to become great, or to draw where it pleaſe, Unjuſtly or Juſtly, all the Countries that depend upon it; And th' Houſe of <hi>Auſtria</hi> 'th made it appear, ſince <hi>Charls</hi> the fifth was Elected to that Dignity, and had Fortified the Powers of th' Empire by the Conjunction of ſo many gathered or uſurped Countries. The moſt remarkable Means, and which have made moſt Noiſe, whereof he and his Succeſſors have made Advantage, or Endeavoured it t' Extend their Greatneſs under the ſhadow of that Dignity, are theſe.</p>
                  <pb n="140" facs="tcp:33686:81"/>
                  <p> The firſt is, the Leagues which they've made or found in <hi>Germany,</hi> and which they've ever had th' Addreſs to fit to their Intereſts under other Pretences, and to Convert them to their par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular Ends under colour of Searching and of Purſuing the good of their Confederates. This Invention hath been one of the Rareſt and Subtileſt Stratagems of their Policy; And they 've ſcarce ever moved any Wheel that hath produced ſuch great Succeſs; That had ſo preſent a Benefit; That hath ſo long Acted, and ſo Inſenſibly as this. By this means they've diſpoſed of Forces that did not belong to them, as of their own; And having not the Foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain in their Power; The Countries of their Friends; They 've had nevertheleſs, the Commodity and uſe of the Stream, That's to ſay, of their Powers. All the World well knows how much time they Imployed t' Invade and Obſtruct the League of <hi>Snaube,</hi> which was not Setled, as hath been obſerved, but to prevent th' Invaſions that were in preparation, and to repair the Violences that were Acted in th' Empire. And th' Hiſtory inſtructs us ſufficiently of the Troubles <hi>Sir</hi> of <hi>Langey</hi> had, to break the Charm that Bound the Members of that League; To give them a Clear ſight of it, and to make them Underſtand that what was prepared for a Remedy, was become their Poyſon, in th' hands of th' Emperour <hi>Charls,</hi> and of <hi>Ferdinand</hi> his Brother; ſo great a Truth it is, That <hi>France</hi> hath alwayes been the Providential Buckler of <hi>Germany,</hi> and th' Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed Rampar, to ſtop the Motions of them, wh' undertake upon its Liberty.</p>
                  <p>'Tis alſo a Thing ſufficiently known in Hiſtory, and whereof w' have made Mention in the laſt Diſcourſe of the ſecond Book, That if th' Emperour had not found Means to form in <hi>Italy</hi> and in <hi>Ger<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>many</hi> a Coun<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="3 letters">

But by the Power of that League, he ſuppreſſed th' other; forced the Gates of the Mutinous Cities to be opened, and might, it may be, have finiſhed his De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſign, which hath been ſince ſo often and unprofitably Attempted, The Reduction of all <hi>Germany,</hi> if he had not been hindered from other places, as hath been related in the precedent Diſcourſe.</p>
                  <p>I will not now Speak of it, becauſe I have amply ſpoken in the ſecond Book of that League, which in <hi>Germany</hi> is called Catholique;
<pb n="153" facs="tcp:33686:81"/>'Tis true, That never any League was made of greater Importance, or of a more regular or ſtronger conſtitution for th' intereſts of th' Houſe of <hi>Auſtria.</hi> And though it had only for Foundation, and pretence of it's Eſtabliſhment, the defence of Religion againſt the Threatning of the Proteſtants; 'Tis certain, that it hath not La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boured, or Lent its Forces to this Time, but to relieve the Ruinous Affairs of th' Emperour; And to make his Succeſs the more Glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious, and his Power the more Fearfull. Another Expedient which the Poſſeſſion of th' Empire hath furniſhed to th' Houſe of <hi>Auſtria,</hi> t' enable it t' undertake without Puniſhment upon other Chriſtian Princes, and to make the preparations of their Enterprizes without Trouble and Allowance of Jealouſie to their Enemies, hath been the ſpecial Obligation th'Empire impoſeth upon <hi>Germany</hi> to make War to the <hi>Turk,</hi> and the particular Perſonage, which th' Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour ſuſtains of Adverſary to that great Enemy of the Faithfull. And nevertheleſs, how often hath <hi>Charls</hi> the fifth raiſed Great Forces, and Commanded <hi>Germany</hi> to do the Like under that pretence; And how often hath he deceived the World, and given the <hi>Germans</hi> the Dog t' hold, in Turning his Arms againſt <hi>France,</hi> or to th' Oppreſſion of ſome of our Allies? As it hapned to the Duke of <hi>Guelders;</hi> And when we made ſhew of raiſing Men at the Noiſe of thoſe preparations; when we put our ſelves into ſome Poſture to ſecure our ſelves againſt the Storm that Threatned us; when we would have uſed ſome Precaution to give a Neceſſary ſecurity; Then the Declarations and Invectives were buſie; Then their Cartells and Manifeſts were publiſhed; That the Conclaves and Dyets were Troubled with the Complaints they made againſt our Kings, and th' Accuſations wherewith they did Charge them, in diverting them from an Holy War, and by th'Intelligence they held, as they would have it, with the <hi>Turk,</hi> to the prejudice of <hi>Chriſtendome,</hi> and the Princes of it; ſo that by th' Artifices and Practices of th' Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour, we were reduced to that ſad Condition, and to that hard Neceſſity, either to Suffer our ſelves to be ſurprized in th' Ill of the Time that was framed; as it once hapned to <hi>Francis</hi> the firſt; or t' hazard the blame of Inſenſibility and Coldneſs for Religion, if we prepared not ſome Shelter and ſome Recrute to ſecure us; as it hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned t' <hi>Henry the Second.</hi>

                  <p>I will ſay, upon this Occaſion, and for the Direction of the Reader; That the Succeſſors of <hi>Charls</hi> have not loſt by his Exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, and that they've been moſt Worthy Imitators of ſo good a Maſter. <hi>Barbary</hi> hath been often the Viſible Subject of th' Armies they have Raiſed, and of the Naval Forces they've ſent againſt <hi>France;</hi> 'Tis an Artifice, which ſeems Natural and Infuſed into the Blood of <hi>Spain.</hi> And Examples have been ſeen in the paſt Ages; And in Times, when Deceits did not paſs for Prudence, and when there was Ordinarily in the World, Faith that was pure, and ſincerity that was not Sophiſticated.</p>
                  <pb n="154" facs="tcp:33686:82"/>
                  <p> Behold, a Remarkable paſſage; After the <hi>Peter</hi> the third King of <hi>Arragon</hi> had loſt <hi>Sicily,</hi> and that w' had taken that fair Iſland from him, which was not leſs dear t' him than the Kingdome of <hi>Spain;</hi> As he was a Great Maſter in th' Art of Diſſimulation, He preſently made ſhew of Conſolation in his Loſs, and though his Heart bled inwardly, He made no ſhew of Grief, and diſcovered no Thoughts of repair but on the <hi>Barbarian</hi> Coaſt. Upon ſo ſpecious a Report, which he ſcattered in all places, and plauſible Impreſſion for t' Entertain other Chriſtian Princes; H' obliged ſome of them, and amongſt them was St. <hi>Lewis,</hi> t' aid him with Money, to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vide Ships, and to make ready a Naval Army, which h' intended for ſo Holy an Expedition. That good Prince, who knew not how to Reign but for the Glory of God, and on whom the Crown he woar, had weighed too much, if Charity had not ſupported it, failed not t' aſſiſt ſo pious an Enterprize, and was eaſily ſurprized by ſo ſubtil a Device, and by ſo delicate a Bait. But this Army which ought t' have Conquered <hi>Afrique,</hi> and put to the Sword th' Infidells of that Country, had n' other Object than the Ruine of the <hi>French,</hi> that were in <hi>Sicily,</hi> and by a Supercery without Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample, and by a Sea of ſpilt Blood, not to be parallel'd, Comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded thoſe infamous <hi>Veſpers,</hi> which ſince have been called <hi>Sicilian Veſpers.</hi> 'Tis not, to ſpeak Clearly of this Affair, That it was a Crime in <hi>Peter,</hi> if there had been no other Thing in it than to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceal a Deſign that could not have proſpered but by ſilence, or that th' Anſwer he made to <hi>Martin</hi> the fourth, deſerved not Commen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation, who ſent to Demand of him, For what place that great preparation and powerfull Fleet was intended; <hi>That if his Shirt knew, what he had in his heart, He would burn it at that inſtant.</hi> Princes truly are not obliged to make known their Secrets t' other Princes, and to give Account of all their Actions to them that would Demand it.

And to Convert a Matter ordained to an Holy uſe, to the Maſſacre and Slaughter of <hi>Lewis</hi> his Subjects. What I ſhall Inferr from theſe Examples, and from many others of the ſame Nature, which th' Houſe of <hi>Auſtria</hi> may abundantly Furniſh, is; That there's too great a Facility, and too ſtupid a Diſpoſition in the Souls of many Perſons, and particularly in the Souls of them, wh' are inflamed with Devotion, and make profeſſion of a Life, more reformed than that of other Men, To believe all things, which the Confederates and Agents of th'Houſe of <hi>Auſtria</hi> publiſh in favour of its Piety; That the Zeal which ſeems to burn there for Religion, is ſometimes Nothing elſe but a fire in Picture, and a Zeal in ſhew; And that the fair Apparence which dazels ſo many mens Eyes, reſembles the Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lours of the Bow in Heaven, which are but an Illuſion and a Deceit for th' Eyes of ſilly Perſons.</p>

                  <p>A Third Expedient, which th'Empire doth furniſh their Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rours withall, t' advance, and promote their Affairs in diſtri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buting of favours, or in raiſing of Troubles, is the power, be it law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full or uſurped, they have from all time aſſumed to the Convocation and Aſſembly of oecumenique Councils. There's no queſtion, that being the moſt exalted Heads of the Secular Body of <hi>Christendome,</hi> or by reaſon of ſome particular Right annexed to their Dignity (If any hath been annexed) But that they 'nterpoſe with more Authority and Awe than other Princes in thoſe great and Important Aſſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blies; And eſpecially in theſe laſt Ages, where it hath been of Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſity to Treat of Temporal as of Eccleſiaſtical affairs, In regard of th'Heretique and Infidel Powers; That th' Emperour had it in his Choice to render himſelf formidable or indulgent to whom he plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed. And as 'tis the condition of Mans Spirit t' over-reach things permitted, and t'Enlarge the Limits of Juriſdiction; And inſtead of providing a Remedy, againſt th'Invaſion of Infidels, and the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection of Heretiques by convenient Means, hath endeavoured t' im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe a yoak upon Popes, and to put Fetters upon their feet; As th' Ambaſſadours of <hi>Charls</hi> the fifth ſaid upon the Subject of the Councel of <hi>Trent;</hi> And have Cheriſhed the Murmurs of <hi>Heretiques</hi> and their Complaints againſt the Church, by reaſon of the Catholiques de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portments, and chiefly, in reſpect of the vices and th'abuſes whereof they Accuſed the Court of <hi>Rome.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>This Reformation truly of particular Manners, is a thing much to be deſired, and it hath been alwaies the wiſh of Honeſt Men to ſee th' antient Diſcipline reflouriſh, and th'Innocency of the Golden Age of the Church to Revive. But works are no ſo eaſie to be done, as wiſhe made; And the Pope by whoſe Authority the Councel of <hi>Trent</hi> was Called or Hold, had reaſon to Declare it Juſt; That the Church ſhould be purged of the Corruption ſtollen into ſome of its Members, and the Spots taken away that had Disfigured ſome of his <hi>Legates.</hi>

                  <p>As to th'Heretiques, who've ſeparated themſelves upon the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence of obſerving Corruption in the Church, and have done it, ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſing it to be true, upon th'occaſion of a greater Curruption; That they were unworthy Brothers, wh' inſtead of Labouring the Reco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very of their ſick Brethren, ſuffered them to dye for want of Help, and unnatural Children who forſook th'old Age of their Mother, upon Pretence, that Her beauty decayed, and that they diſcovered ſome Spot or Wrinkle upon her face. That the ſuperfluities and Excreſcencies of the Tree, if there were any, and the hanging Boughs ought to be cut off; but not the Tree cut down at the root; That they made War, to the Luxury, to the Pomp, and other Vices of the Court of <hi>Rome,</hi> which were th'Appurtenances of the ſenſes, and of the Matter; And to the Pride and Felony, and to th'other Sins, which Aryſing from the Spirit had the more dangerous Venome, and were of a Superiour order in Malice.</p>
                  <p>Let's return to our Subject, and for Proof and Confirmation of what we've above ſaid; Let's not forget t'obſerve, that the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cel of <hi>Trent</hi> in the Progreſs of its Convocation, or in its Continuance, was in th'hands of <hi>Charls</hi> the fifth, like a knife that did one while Cut againſt the Pope, another while againſt the Proteſtants of <hi>Germany;</hi> or as an Inſtrument, whereof He made uſe, ſometimes to gain th' Inclinations of the very Proteſtants, and to draw them t' his ſide; Sometimes to make himſelf Acceptable to the <hi>Pope,</hi> and to place him in his Intereſts; And ſo by the Means of Fear and Hope, and by the Miniſtration of thoſe two powerfull paſſions, Endeavoured to Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vern all <hi>Rome,</hi> and in <hi>Germany,</hi> To give the Law to the people of <hi>Christendome,</hi> and to Circumvent and Undermine <hi>France,</hi> and to take away the great Counterpoiſe he found againſt th' Execution of his Deſigns by the force of this Kingdome.</p>
                  <p>To the Proteſtants, full of <hi>Luthers</hi> Spirit, and poyſoned with his Doctrine, who burnt with Hatred againſt th' <hi>Holy Chair,</hi> He pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſed the Convocation of a Councel, wherein the Popes Authority ſhould be reformed; And to the Pope, ready to burſt with Grief, to ſee ſuch great Schiſm, and defection of ſo many Souls, who breathed not, but for their Return to the boſome of the Church, and their Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>union
<pb n="157" facs="tcp:33686:83"/>to the Center of its Unity, th' <hi>Holy Chair,</hi> He gave hopes of commanding the Proteſtants t'attend at the Councell; And in caſe they ſhould refuſe to ſubmit t' its Reſolutions and Decrees, to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrain them; And for that purpoſe, he cauſed his Threatnings to b' Intimated to the Proteſtants, and frighted them with th'Armies of th'<hi>Holy Chair,</hi> which he would ſtrengthen with his Armes; And 'twas then, when they appeared averſe t' his deſire, and that they would not Conſpire and Labour Joyntly with him in the Ruine of <hi>France,</hi> which was th'End of his Artifices. At another Time he 'n<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavoured to terrifie the <hi>Pope,</hi> and threatned ſo to Bridle him by the Councel, and to reduce his power to ſuch ſtreight Limits, That He would repent him of the want of Compliance to his deſires, and of conſent to the paſſions He had againſt <hi>France;</hi> And to render us O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dious to the Proteſtants, and to ſharpen th'Hatred H' had Imprinted againſt us, and to make fruitful the Seeds which H' had long before Sowed, He made them believe, That we were the Cauſe that the Councel did not hold in places Convenient, and afford Convenient Conditions for them; And at other times, He would aggravate be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the <hi>Pope</hi> the Precautions which were offered, and the Preſerva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tives, wherewith we were furniſned, to provide againſt the practi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces they formed, and th'Evils they prepared againſt us at <hi>Rome</hi> and the Councel.</p>
                  <p>Inſomuch, that we had an hard Task t'undeceive the <hi>Germans,</hi> to whom h' had given ſuch Siniſter Impreſſions of our Conduct, and had uſe of an Extraordinary Induſtry, Boldneſs, and good Fortune to make abortive the propoſals, which his Ambaſſadors made at <hi>Trent;</hi> That all <hi>Chriſtendome</hi> would make a League to force us to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounce th' Alliance made with the <hi>Turk,</hi> though no uſe was made of it, but for the Good of Chriſtians, and for a neceſſary defence; And to re-eſtabliſh the Duke of <hi>Savoy</hi> his Uncle in the places of his Countrey, which w' had taken, though Lawfully and by a Juſt Title of War; And for other Ends that concerned them, and not <hi>Chriſten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome,</hi> and that tended to the Promotion of their Intereſts, and not to th' Advancement of the Churches Intereſt. From thence Iſſued thoſe prudent Neceſſary proteſtations, which <hi>Henry</hi> the ſecond Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded to be publiſht at <hi>Rome,</hi> and at <hi>Trent,</hi> by his Ambaſſadors, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt thoſe Conſpiracies, and Monopolies; From thence came that General Reſiſtance, which the <hi>Suiſses</hi> made to the practices of the <hi>Popes Nuncio,</hi> Invented by th' Emperor, and to the violence of his Endeavors to remove them from our Allyance, and t' impede the permiſſion of the Levies of Souldiers to be made in their Countrey in our favour.</p>
                  <p>I will not here forget a Remarkable paſſage of <hi>Charls</hi>'s ill-will to <hi>France,</hi> though the <hi>Turk</hi> was the publique Adverſary, as we've al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready ſaid, which th' Imperial Dignity did aſſign him, and that the Contributions of th'Empire, which they call <hi>Romas Zuk,</hi> are princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pally ordained to make War againſt the <hi>Turke.</hi> That though the
<pb n="158" facs="tcp:33686:84"/>Princes and Proteſtant States, t'eaſe them of th'importunities th' Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peror made them t' aid him againſt us; As unwilling to ſhake the foundations of their ſubſiſtence, which are in the Protections of this Crown, and to give th'occaſion of a nobler Trial, more worthy of his Dignity, made an offer to ſerve him with an hundred thouſand Men againſt the <hi>Turk;</hi> Yet he refuſed them, and was obſtinate in having that relief and ſubvention againſt the Crown of <hi>France.</hi> Another paſſage alſo, no leſs remarkable, muſt not be forgot, of the reſpect this Prince paid, and th' eſteem he rendred to th' <hi>Holy Chair,</hi> and to the Councel, for to gain th' heart of the Proteſtants, and t' employ their Forces againſt us; He permitted them, during the ſitting of the Councel, and before, in the view of the <hi>Legat,</hi> and the <hi>Nuntios</hi> of the <hi>Pope,</hi> and without their interpoſition; He permitted them, I ſay, divers Aſſemblies and Conferences, t' handle there, and reſolve of ſeveral Points that concern Religion, and which ought t'have been decided by the Councel. This was in effect to ſettle He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſie by his Authority, which had been planted by his Connivence, and give a new Title to thoſe Errors, which were believed to be but too deeply rooted. If any thing of like nature had been acted by our Kings, and if they had ſo inſolently forgot, that they were children of the Church, there had not been Lightning enough in the <hi>Vatican</hi> t' have darted on our heads in the judgment of our Adverſaries; There had not been Colours black enough t' obſcure their Honour, nor Satyrs violent enough to blaſt it. No queſtion will be made of this Truth, if memory b' had of the Noiſe, which the Diſcourſe of <hi>Poiſſy</hi> made at our Neighbours Courts and ours, though it was aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſembled by the <hi>Pope</hi>'s conſent in the preſence of th' Apoſtolique <hi>Le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gat,</hi> and t'appeaſe the Schiſm which toar us in piece, and to degrade Hereſie with the greater Solemnity, as the Cardinal of <hi>Lorrain</hi> had made the King to believe it. And nevertheleſs, for ſuch wicked En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terprizes, and ſuch ſacrilegious Attempts, as thoſe of th'Emperour, they murmured at <hi>Rome,</hi> but betwixt the Teeth, and ſecret Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaints onely were made, and Diſcourſes in th'Ear; And whether the ſoftneſs of ſome of the Court would not permit the Power and Fortune of <hi>Charls</hi> to be juſtled, or that Prudence did adviſe Diſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mulation, and the Concealment of an Evil, which to chaſtiſe had been a dangerous thing; This proceeding paſſed unpuniſhed at <hi>Rome;</hi> Th'Arms of th' <hi>Holy Chair</hi> were not employed to puniſh it; And th' Houſe of <hi>Austria</hi> hath not ſince failed to conſerve amongſt its Subjects, but alſo amongſt the Subjects of other Princes, the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>putation of being the Sword and Buckler of the Church; For that Houſe is ſo powerful in Artifices, that it hath cloſe and ſubtil Wheels to remove beliefs, and fine and ſmall Plaiſters to diſguiſe its foulneſs, and cover its faults; And 'tis true alſo, that <hi>France</hi> is un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>happy in that behalf, and that the zeal it hath ever had for Religion, and reſpect it hath ever born to th' <hi>Holy Chair,</hi> have ſcarce gained belief amongſt men, and t'inſinuate into the ſpirits of its own Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren,
<pb n="159" facs="tcp:33686:84"/>and alſo of them wh' have truely piety and good Intentions, but give too much way to their heat, which is not ſufficiently en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lightned nor diſcreet, and too little credit to the light of others, whoſe heat is prudent and conſiderate.</p>
                  <p>A fourth Expedient, capable to gain Countries at eaſie Charges, and Victories without Combat, which th'Emperors of th'Houſe of <hi>Auſtria</hi> would introduce into th' Empire, and would have carried them far, if they had not been hindred, and if <hi>France</hi> had not been found in their way to ſtop them; Is, The device of Sequeſtrations; This Stratagem hath ſo bad a Conſequence to the Liberty of the Princes and States which depend upon th'Empire, that even the moſt affect onate to th'Houſe of <hi>Auſtria</hi> have been afraid, and were ſcan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dalized. And the Duke of <hi>Bavaria,</hi> who from all times hath been one of the Pillars that hath ſupported the Greatneſs of that Houſe, ſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciently underſtood it in that ſenſe, by a Letter of the 13<hi rend="sup">th</hi> of <hi>Decemb.</hi> 1629. which <hi>Sir Jocherius</hi> writ in his name to <hi>Sir</hi> the <hi>Nuntius Bagny,</hi> in Anſwer to what the ſaid <hi>Nuntius</hi> had written of the 5<hi rend="sup">th</hi> of <hi>October</hi> in the ſame year, by which he repreſented unt' him on the Kings behalf, <hi>The conſequence of th'Emperor's Refuſal, at the requeſt of the</hi> Spaniards, <hi>to give th' Inveſtiture of ſuch Eſtates to them who were the Lawful Heirs, and comprehended in the first Inveſtitures, and to ſtrip them to the ſaid Eſtates by the means of Sequeſtration.</hi> This concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the laſt Duke of <hi>Mantoua.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>They began to take this way, and to put this Deſign in practice, after the death of <hi>William</hi> Duke of <hi>Cleves.</hi> The <hi>Spaniards,</hi> that would upon any account invade his Succeſſion, which, beſides th'Extent and Goodneſs of the Country, was of marvellous con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veniency for them; Obtained of th'Emperour, That he would ceize upon <hi>Julliers</hi> by th' Arch-duke <hi>Leopald</hi> their King's Brother in Law, and hold that place in Sequeſtration, till h' had judged to whom of right the Succeſſion did belong, and had in Juſtice determined that famous difference, wherein there were ſo many knots t'untie, and ſo many Parties to content; That the deciſion could not but be very long, and very difficult. This Invention of Sequeſtration, if it had been in their power t'have ſetled it, would have given them Means, under the pretext of Juſtice, t'have aſſured themſelves in time of the poſſeſſion of what did not belong unto them, and whereof they were ceized by a meer congruity. And there's nothing truer, but that of Pretenders, whereof there's ever ſome of them at their diſpoſitions; or the nature of the buſineſs, which cannot be ſo neat and clear, but that there will ever be ſome Shadow or Clowd that would be hard to diſperſe; or the Forms alſo of Juſtice, ſ' often contrary to th' Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pedition of Juſtice, would make ſo many Difficulties t'ariſe, and diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cover ſo many Incidents, that the true Maſters of a contentious Good, tired with delays, without an end, and diſpairing of ever drawing it from ſo powerful and covetous hands, as theirs that re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained it from them, ſhould be compelled t' hearken to Propoſals
<pb n="160" facs="tcp:33686:85"/>made them, to receive a Compenſation, and to take ſome real and effective thing, for a few hopes ill grounded, and for ſome vain and frivolous Titles. Inſomuch, that they would become in Apparence Lawful Maſters of that, whereof they were before but unlawful De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainers; And what in the beginning, and in its original, was nothing but force and violence, would in its progreſs and ſequel take the vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſage and the colours of Juſtice.</p>
                  <p>In that manner, the <hi>Spaniards</hi> had reſolved t'handle the Duke of <hi>Mantoua,</hi> if he would have conſented to the Sequeſtration of the Cittadel of <hi>Caſal;</hi> And they would, it may be, have done the like t'him, if they had taken that place by force, as they made great Aſſaults to take it. Th'Offer which they cauſed to be made unt'him of <hi>Cremonis,</hi> with reſervation of the Cittadel of <hi>Cremona,</hi> or of ſome other Country of like value in the <hi>French</hi> County, inſtead of <hi>Mont<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferrat,</hi> is a tacit Approbation of the Violence they exerciſed, becauſe they did endeavour in ſome meaſure to repair it, and a manifeſt Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gument of the proceeding they would hold in th' uſe of Sequeſtra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, and by th'Introduction of that new Expedient, t' inſinuate in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the Countries, which are commodious for them, under ſome form of Equity, and in preſerving th'Apparences of Juſtice.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Charls</hi> the Fifth in truth, in the difference which hath ſo long ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erciſed the Dukes of <hi>Savoy,</hi> of <hi>Mantoua,</hi> and of other Princes, upon the ſubject of <hi>Montferrat,</hi> did not proceed by way of Sequeſtration, before h' had given judgment upon that Affair. Th' Enterpriſe ſeemed unt' him too bold and jealous, reſpect being had to the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent Conjuncture; And h'underſtood well, that it cooled the good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>will or them whom h'had a deſire to keep in Newtrality; That fear ſtopped his deſire t'uſurp <hi>Montferrat,</hi> under the pretext lately men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned; And he choſe rather to draw that buſineſs into length, and to make uſe of it as a Lure or a Bait to draw the Duke of <hi>Savoy</hi> t' his Party, and to deboſh from our Intereſts the Marquis of <hi>Saluſſe,</hi> in hopes that the <hi>Montferrat,</hi> on which h' had alſo pretenſions, ſhould b'adjudged t'him; As <hi>Antonio de Leve</hi> had given him t'under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand. At laſt, having long plaid with the Duke's credulity, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived the Marquis, h' adjudged the poſſeſſion of <hi>Montferrat</hi> to the Duke of <hi>Mantoua,</hi> and left the claim to the Duke of <hi>Savoy,</hi> to purſue it civilly, and according to the forms of Juſtice in th' Imperial Chamber. He did not intend to make him Greater, on whoſe Countries h' had great deſignes, and whom he would not permit to be Maſter of the Barriere which ſevers <hi>France</hi> from <hi>Italy,</hi> and <hi>Keeper</hi> of the Gate by which the <hi>French</hi> might enter. His Succeſſors have been more hardy and inconſiderate than he was, and have ſtirred an Engine, which is never ſhaken, but to their ſhame and ruine; For that cauſe they raiſed a cruel and long War in <hi>Italy,</hi> but what they gained thereby, was to fall by the juſt judgment of God into the Precipice they would have avoided, and to draw the <hi>French</hi> into that Country, whom they would for ever have excluded.</p>
                  <pb n="161" facs="tcp:33686:85"/>
                  <p> Let's return to the Matter of Sequeſtrators, who've plunged us ſo deep into this Subject, and obſerve it, as a ſtrange thing, that the <hi>Spaniards,</hi> wh' approved of them as plauſible and juſt in other mens affairs, will not hear talk of them in matters of Conteſt that concern them. And all the world knows, that in the Succeſſion of <hi>Portugal,</hi> Which five or ſix Pretenders rendred famous in the time of our Fathers, <hi>Philip</hi> the Second would never conſent, that that Kingdom ſhould be put in Depoſite, or permit, as he ſaid, his Right to depend upon another mans Judgment, which nevertheleſs was ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver ſo clear and indubitable, as that of the Marquis of <hi>Brandeburg,</hi> and of the Duke of <hi>Newberge</hi> for the Succeſſion of the Countries of <hi>Cleves;</hi> And that of the Duke of <hi>Nevers</hi> to the Succeſſion of <hi>Mantoua.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>A Fifth Expedient to grow Greater, and a Right which th'Empire ſometimes appropriates for its Advancement and Enlargement, Is the Confiſcation of the Feifes which do ariſe; But in regard that we will treat of them in the Third Part, of th' Affairs of th <hi>Palati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate,</hi> and make a ſtay therein of purpoſe, at leaſt if ſome prudent conſideration do not hinder us, we will content our ſelves in ſending the <hi>Reader</hi> thither, and paſs on, having onely obſerved, That th'Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perial Dignity brings with it theſe great Rights, and fair Preroga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tives, and that it ſhines by theſe Illuſtrious Privileges, above all the Secular Dignities of <hi>Christendom.</hi> But inſomuch, that th'Abuſes and Exceſſes of great Powers are not leſs dangerous, than the over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flowings of great Rivers; And that they reſemble to the Chariot of the <hi>Sun,</hi> the Poets feign, which cannot go out of its natural walk, nor quit the Ecliptick Line; without burning a part of the World. The Powers of Emperors are limited, as in other places hath been ſaid, and Boundaries are raiſed, that they may not go out of their Places, nor paſs their Limits; The Pathes H' ought to walk in are ſet out unt' him, and the Courſe h' ought to take, by the pragmatique Sanctions, and by the Reſolutions of the Dyets of the Princes and States of th'Empire. Thoſe Laws and Reſolutions Moderate that Power, and make that Symetrie of Temper, and Harmony of Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mours of all the Body, whereof th'Emperors are but th'Head; 'Tis, what th'Elector <hi>Maurice</hi> of <hi>Saxe</hi> intended, when he ſaid, That <hi>Ger<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>many</hi> advanced ſo many paces to its ruine, as th'Emperor added new Degrees t' his Power; and that it might b' ever free and flouriſhing, it was neceſſary always to conſerve the Princes Authority and their Power, in the Conſtitution of th'Empire, which were the Counter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poiſe that ballanc'd it.</p>
                  <p>But ſince it was very hard to maintain the Evenneſs of the Counterpoiſe, and that Ambition, like the Fire, ſays, 'Tis never enough; And that to rule it breaks all the Chains that Juſtice thinks to with-hold it by, and reſpects neither Laws nor Cuſtoms to ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfie its Ends; Support for th' Empire hath been ſought out of th'Empire, and the Subſiſtence of the Body and Liberty of the Members have in a ſpecial manner been under the Protection of
<pb n="162" facs="tcp:33686:86"/>
                     <hi>France.</hi> In what way this Protection is formed, whether by Reci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>procal Treaties, or by Cuſtom changed into the Force of a Law; What this Crown hath ever practiſed t' haſten the Relief of th' Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pire, and hinder the Diſſolution of the Body, and th' Annihilation of its Natural Form; 'Tis not any buſineſs here t'enquire after; 'Tis ſufficient that the <hi>Germans</hi> are agreed, and have always declared it in their Treaties, which they've made with our Kings, when they were to be redeemed from vexation, and came t'implore their En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavours or Arms. This Formal Acknowledgment, and Expreſs Declaration is ſeen in the League of th'Elector <hi>Maurice,</hi> and th'other Princes his Aſſociates, made with <hi>Henry</hi> the Second, to ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cure <hi>Germany</hi> from th'Irons which <hi>Charls</hi> the Fifth would have im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed on it; That theres no queſtion to be made of it; Inſomuch that <hi>France</hi> cannot b'accuſed of Temerity, or of Undertaking, when it appears in th'Affairs of <hi>Germany,</hi> and that it interpoſeth its Cares and Arms, That the Ballance ſpoken of ſtand ſtreight, and Lean not on th' Emperor's, nor on the Princes ſide, and Free Towns of th'Empire.</p>
                  <p>I ſpeak not here, becauſe I've elſe-where done it, of that General and Indefinite Obligation, which Great Perſons have to relieve In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feriour perſons when they're oppreſſed; The common Law of Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manity, whereof they're not exempt, and the particular Law of Charity, which ſometimes enters into their Conduct, exact this Du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of all that can render it; And the Law of their Intereſt, which is the ſupreme and powerful Law of Princes, doth ſufficiently preſs them t' hinder the Great from devouring the Leſſer perſons, leſt they ſhould grow too Great, and leſt Power enflaming their Ambi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, thruſt them on, and extend it to the Dominions of other Princes. I ſpeak not alſo of another Obligation, more Bounded and Circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribed, which <hi>France</hi> hath to protect ſome Princes and particular States of th'Empire, and to b' a Shelter and Haven unto them in time of Perſecution and Tempeſt; Such as the protection and ſafe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guard it owes particularly to th'Elector of <hi>Treves,</hi> which was re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpected by the King of <hi>Swede,</hi> and Sacred with victorious Heretiques, with whom neither he nor we had any War; 'Tis true, That th'aid which <hi>France</hi> owes to th'Empire, when 'tis threatned with Ruine, hath not much appeared ſince it entred into th'houſe of <hi>Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtria,</hi> but in favour of the Members againſt th' Enterprizes of the Chief; As alſo th'oppreſſion and violence which hath been oppoſed, proceeded from that ſide, and had their Beginning in th'Invaſions the Princes of that Houſe would have made upon the Liberty of others. Yet <hi>France</hi> failed not the laſt Emperor, when there was need of it. And if in the Troubles of <hi>Bohemia,</hi> and after thoſe happy beginnings, and the viſible Evidences of a more happy Sequel of the <hi>Palatine</hi>'s Arms, the King had not permitted the <hi>French</hi> to go out of <hi>France,</hi> to fortifie th'Emperor's Troops, and ſent the moſt Solemn and Il<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luſtrious Ambaſſy, which of a long time hath gone out of this King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom,
<pb n="163" facs="tcp:33686:86"/>t'untie the Proteſtant League, and break the Courſe of their Proſperity, Th' Emperor had run th' hazard of being ſtript of his Countries, and t'have tried the ſame fortune he hath made the <hi>Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>latine</hi> to ſuffer, and to become Penſioner to the <hi>Spaniards,</hi> as th'other hath been to th' <hi>Hollanders.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>'Tis eaſie to conclude, from what hath been above-ſaid, That 'tis not without Reaſon, that th'Houſe of <hi>Auſtria</hi> makes th'Empire the Baſis and Centre of their pretended Monarchy; That 'tis not with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out Reaſon, that the late Emperor writing to the King of <hi>Spain,</hi> t' incline him t' approve of the tranſlation of th' Electorat of the <hi>Count Palatine</hi> to the Perſon of the Duke of <hi>Bavaria,</hi> repreſented unt' him the conſideration, That it had ever been the Judgment of their Predeceſſors, that the Seat, whereupon the Greatneſs of their Houſe ought to reſt, was <hi>Germany,</hi> and that th' Empire was th'higheſt and the moſt eminent piece of all <hi>Germany;</hi> That that Dignity was to be conſerved in their Houſe above all other things; And that the promotion of <hi>Baviere,</hi> and of his Succeſſors to th' Electorate, ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dring the Suffrages of the Catholick Electors ſuperior in number, which ſhould ever deſcend to the Princes of that Race, the poſſeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of th'Empire would be the better eſtabliſhed, and what in Form and Apparences might appear Elective, would in Effect and Subſtance become Hereditary. And the late King, wh' had ſo many Natural and Acquired Lights of the things of this world, and in whom the good ſenſe, wherewith he was born, was ſo much im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prov'd by th'Experience h' had gain'd, ſaid in a contrary ſenſe to that of the Duke of <hi>Anhalt,</hi> when he was ſent unt' him from the Princes of <hi>Germany,</hi> wh' had made a League with him, to be delivered in good earneſt from th'Attempts and Allarms, which they ſ' often re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived from th' Houſe of <hi>Auſtria,</hi> That it was neceſſary to force th' Empire from that Houſe, where it ſeem'd t' have taken root, and to paſs it int' another Catholique Houſe, but leſs Ambitious; And having ſhorter and weaker Wings, might not extend them ſo far, nor flie ſo high.</p>
                  <p>But Death cauſed that magnificent Project to miſcarry, when it was but in the Flower, and th' Execution it may b' is reſerved for ſome of his Heirs, who may inherit ſuch magnanimous Thoughts, and march upon ſuch generous Impreſſions as the King doth at this time; Wh' is as worthy an Imitator of the Virtues of his Father, as Lawful Succeſſor of his Kingdom; He's inflamed with the ſame zeal for th' eſtabliſhment of the Peace of <hi>Christendom,</hi> and hath this ſatisfaction, t' have omitted nothing that might b' inſtrumental to cut off that fatal Succeſſion of th'Empire from th'Houſe that en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joys it; And that Tranſaction of ill Augury, which is made from th'one to th'other, in the Perſons of their Princes. That he ſpares not any thing to reduce th' Empire to its firſt Condition, and antient Form; That what they would make Abſolute and Monarchick, is temper'd by th' Ariſtocracy convenient and proper for it; And that
<pb n="164" facs="tcp:33686:87"/>all is Governed in <hi>Germany</hi> by the Laws and Conſtitutions there Eſtabliſhed, and not by th' Ambition and Capricious humours of them, who would put themſelves above the Conſtitutions and Laws. That by the Re-eſtabliſhment of that fair Order, and by th' Obſervation of Things that ought to maintain it, The Peace, which ought to be given to the World, b'Eſtabliſhed in great Safety, and that the Remembrance of Evils paſt, whereof the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn will not be feared, ſerve only t' Augment the ſweetneſs of pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent Benefits, which are not in danger to be loſt. We ſhall ſhortly be ſenſible of the Time of this moſt happy Condition, and though the War ſeems to be ſtronger and hotter than it hath formerly been, 'Tis the laſt Breath it yields up, and the Livelieſt flames of a Torch, which is ready to go out.</p>

                  <p>HAving cleared and unfolded that Principle of the Doctrine, which <hi>Ferdinand</hi> left t' his Succeſſors to gain the Monarchy; Lets ſee, what profits they've made of it, and what hath been th' Harveſt of ſ' admirable a Seed, Death which took away <hi>Philip</hi> of <hi>Austria</hi> in the Life of <hi>Maximilian</hi> th'Emperour his Father, permitted him not to carry his Thoughts out of <hi>Spain,</hi> nor to La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour at the Work, whereof his Father-in-Law had drawn the Platform, and which ſo long Exerciſed, and ſo Vainly, his Son <hi>Charls.</hi> This <hi>Charls</hi> then failed not, to turn his firſt paces of Youth towards th' Empire; And though the Steps which carried to this higheſt Dignity, were Rude and Slippery, and that many Enemies were to b' Overcome, and Barriers broken before Arrival there, yet he undertook it. The Maternal Family, from whence he iſſued, was had in Jealouſie with the <hi>Germans,</hi> wh' had no mind to ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit, but t' a Blood purely <hi>German,</hi> and that ſhould receive no Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teration by a proud and ſubtil Mixture, as was that of <hi>Spain;</hi> He found alſo upon his way, a brave and powerfull Competitor; And <hi>Francis</hi> the firſt, as well as himſelf, aimed at the purchaſe of a Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtreſs, for ſo th' Emperour called th' Empire, which was worthy of all his Love, of all his Fortune and Powers.</p>
                  <p>H' overcame, nevertheleſs, theſe two Obſtacles, and was happy enough in allaying th' Averſion of the <hi>Germans,</hi> and in Triumphing over the perſutes of the <hi>French.</hi> The manner of the proceedings of theſe two Princes in this glorious Addreſs, was very different;

                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>ood inferiour t' his Rival, who beſides th' Advantages of his paternal Birth, added Threatnings and Force, and made his ſolici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations in th' Equipage of a Man of War, and accompanied with a good Army. This high pretenſion having been Crowned with the Succeſs he deſired, invited him to form another, to which that ſerved, as a Plank, as hath been ſaid, for the Chriſtian Monarchy; And the youth wherein he then found himſelf, made him alſo hope, That h' had time enough for the Cariere, and was long t' Enjoy the good h' ought to gather at th' End of that courſe.</p>
                  <p>But th' Execution of this great Project, anſwered not his Hopes, and Fortune made them to Vaniſh, when they made the faireſt and moſt pleaſing ſhew; The Monarchy wherewith he was ſo be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>witched, ſlipt almoſt out of his hands, and reſembled th' Apples of the Fables, which falling upon the Lips of the famiſhed <hi>Tantalus,</hi> and having Kiſſed them, fell back and flew away: That hapned twice unto him, The firſt after th' Journey of <hi>Pavia,</hi> where <hi>Francis</hi> the firſt was taken Priſoner; And the ſecond, after the defeat of the Proteſtant League of <hi>Germany,</hi> where the Duke of <hi>Saxe</hi> was alſo defeated. In this ſucceſs, he was ſtopped, when he was moſt Elevated, as hath been often ſaid, and the fore-ſight of <hi>Paul</hi> the third hindered his Progreſs, and cut the Wings of his Victory in the ſtrength of its Flight, and rapidity of its Motion. In th' other he was Blinded with that unexpected proſperity, as with an Exceſs of Light, and finding his Succeſs higher than he had propoſed it, his Head turned in that manner, that he knew not how to take th' Advantages over us, which h' had before his Eyes, nor give his hands to Fortune that would have Led him effectively to what h' had before but in Deſires and Thoughts.</p>
                  <p>However, <hi>Charls</hi> had no ſooner turned his Eyes to the pretended Monarchy, and faced that charming Object, but he found himſelf Oppoſed by two great difficulties in th' Acquiſition of it, which neither he, nor his could ever Overcome, nor heal one of the two Wounds, but th' other was open. The firſt and the moſt Impor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tant, was the want of Men of War, which nevertheleſs was leſs felt in <hi>Charl</hi>'s time, than in his Succeſſors; And the ſecond is the want of Money, wherewith <hi>Charls</hi> was much Troubled, and his Succeſſors leſs felt. And for that Reaſon, it hath hapned unto them for their great deſign, as t' him that would raiſe a great Building in a place where there are no Materials, and having not Command

Above all Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pediments, God permitted, that a conſtant ſupply of Men; the moſt neceſſary thing for th' Accompliſhment of their Work, failed them; for without Men, as all the World knows, great Warrs cannot b' Entertained or Continued, permanent Progreſs cannot be made, nor laſting Conqueſts; A warlike Prince may run and pillage a great Extent of Country, but he cannot take Root, nor ſettle with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out ſupplies of Men. And that Collection of <hi>Bergers</hi> and of <hi>Vaga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bonds,</hi> from whence iſſued the Republique that Commanded all the World, began the Monarchy, which their Succeſſors raiſed in making a Proviſion of Men; in changing th' Inhabitants of Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quered Cities into Citizens, and Burgeſſes of <hi>Rome;</hi> And by 'ſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bliſhing in the Circumvallation of <hi>Rome,</hi> the principal Body, from whence their Armies ſhould be formed, from whence their Gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſons ſhould be drawn, and from whence their Colonies ſhould be ſent. Theſe things nevertheleſs, did not cool th' heat of <hi>Charls,</hi> and theſe Difficulties did but the more inflame his Courage t' over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come them, and above all t'Endeavour th' Opening of ſome Spring of Men of War that might be Plentifull, and t' aſſure himſelf of ſome well peopled Country, that might ſerve for the Recrute of his Armies, and the Relief of all his Loſſes: for that End, <hi>Italy</hi> was very Rich, and well Peopled; <hi>Germany</hi> that was well Peopled, and indifferently Rich, and to which, the <hi>Low-Countries,</hi> whereof he was Lord, ſerved for a Binding and Fringe; And <hi>France,</hi> which had both theſe Conditions, almoſt in an Equal degree, and was equally Peopled and Rich. As to <hi>France,</hi> h' had no Lawfull pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence t' aſſault it, and there's no Country in the World, whoſe Poſſeſſion was more Entire or leſs Troubleſome to its Maſter; Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides, that it was then ſo ſtrong, and ſo well ſemented a Body, and th' Union of th' Head with all the Members was ſo ſtrict and firm, that in the Condition wherein <hi>Charls</hi> then found himſelf, there was no place for hope to Conquer it by Land, not ſo much as to Shake it. For that purpoſe then, t'was neceſſary for him t'attend till he became more Powerfull, and that Fortune offered him ſome juſt Object, or ſome ſpecious Colour t'undertake it, which hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pens, but too often in th' Intricacy of Affairs, and in the Confuſion of the Things of this World.</p>
                  <p>As to <hi>Germany,</hi> and that Vaſt and Warlike Country, where the Men of War do not decay, and where Men are ſeen to be Born, as to Dye in their Armies, Th' Enterprize would bring with it Extreme difficulties, and almoſt Invincible; for though <hi>Charls</hi> was inveſted with th' Imperial Dignity, which is particularly Known and Reverenced in that Country, and that he had there a conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable Patrimony; yet, the Dignity being in it ſelf but a ſingle perſonal Title, or at leaſt not bringing to him, wh' Enjoys it, a handfull of Hereditary Land; And the power Joyned to it, being
<pb n="167" facs="tcp:33686:88"/>but Subaltern and Dependent upon the Reſolutions of the Dyets, and Voluntary contributions of the Princes, and free Towns of th', Empire. But that, and all the reſt of the Revenue of <hi>Charls,</hi> was not ſufficient t' oppoſe the Powers of thoſe Princes and Towns, who would not fail t' unite themſelves to defend the Common Liberty, ſo ſoon as it ſhould be Threatned; And to draw to their party other Powers, who would be Jealous of ſ' Ambitious a Deſign, and In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſs themſelves in Impeding the ſetting up of a New Monarchy in the midſt of <hi>Chriſtendome.</hi> So that he well Underſtood, that he could never ſubdue <hi>Germany,</hi> ſo long as it Continued Entire, and that nothing but the Wind of Diviſion could bring him to th' Haven of his Ambition, and to gain it, many Ships muſt be Rigg'd, and many Tempeſts Endured; And to Conquer it, many Parties were to be ſtirred up, and diſorders kindled in <hi>Germany,</hi> or to b' ever in Arms, and ready t' Embrace all Occaſions that ſhould appear, and to make uſe of the Diſorders which ſhould ariſe.</p>
                  <p>But till Fortune provide ſo propitious an Occaſion, and ſo fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vourable a Conjuncture, the moſt preſent Object, which then ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peared to tempt <hi>Charls</hi>'s humour, was <hi>Italy;</hi> And that fair Country had lo many Temptations to make him in Love, That the paſſion of Conqueſt began to fix on him, and to Dart his firſt flames at it, which truly was no ſtrange thing for th' Emperour, nor for <hi>Italy.</hi> Th' Advantagious ſituation of it, by which it borders <hi>France, Spain,</hi> and <hi>Germany,</hi> and upon the Countries of the <hi>Grand Signior;</hi> The Greatneſs and M<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">

                  <p>Though all this be true, and that th' Excellencies and Inchant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of <hi>Italy</hi> might oblige him t' undertake the Conqueſt, yet th' Execution was not eaſie, and many Inches were to be gone over, and ill wayes to be paſt, before be could Arrive there; for though <hi>Charls</hi> had then one foot in the Country, and was poſſeſſed of <hi>Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples,</hi> one of the faireſt Portions and powerfulleſt Members of <hi>Italy;</hi> 'Tis to be conſidered, That the Country being but at one End of it, and by conſequent, Frontiere to the reſt, He could not advance without Encountring the Church Dominions, and without an Hoſtile Entry, which would have been an odious Buſineſs and Matter of ſcandal t' other Princes, and have raiſed an ill Sent a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt the greateſt part of his Subjects, and even in <hi>Spain;</hi> That th' <hi>Italians</hi> were not a people to be ſurprized by Artifices, or ama<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zed
<pb n="168" facs="tcp:33686:89"/>at Apparences; That they looked far into the future, and very clear int' others Intentions; That they would diſcover his Deſign at the leaſt noiſe he ſhould make, and ſmell the ſent that ſhould evaporate, though never ſo little; That the Jealouſie they had for their Liberty was ſo tender, that a very ſmall Emotion would ſerve t' awaken it; And diſtruſt is ſo natural to them, and they ſharpen it ſo keenly by the vivacity of their underſtanding, and by the ſubtilty of their ſpeculations, that they would not onely take Apprehenſions of viſible things, but alſo ſuſpect often what was not, and give themſelves many falſe Alarms, not to be found aſleep when true ones hapned. And as that Prince in many occaſions was Happy beyond his Hopes, and Prudent above his Contempora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries, in making good uſe of occaſions, Fortune preſented him with a favourable Opportunity for his Deſign, and managed it with ſo much Circumſpection and Wiſdom, that he gained <hi>Milan,</hi> and was ſeized at laſt of the nobleſt part of <hi>Italy.</hi> This Country is the Centre, whoſe Extremities confine almoſt upon all th'other States of <hi>Italy,</hi> and the Line which makes the Communication of <hi>Spain</hi> with <hi>Italy,</hi> by the vicinity of <hi>Genes,</hi> an Appertenant; And of <hi>Italy,</hi> with the <hi>Suiſſes,</hi> the <hi>Griſons,</hi> and the reſt of <hi>Germany,</hi> by the vicinity of the <hi>Voltoline;</hi> 'Tis the place of Arms, and the Rendevous to receive from the <hi>Low-Countries,</hi> or to ſend thither from <hi>Italy, Germany,</hi> and from <hi>Spain,</hi> the Men of War, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of thoſe Countries may have need. Inſomuch that ſince th' Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perour was aſſured of that Country, and had put his foot in <hi>Pied<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mont</hi> and in <hi>Toſcany,</hi> H' had his Reckoning, and took his Meaſures to that End, holding all the Eccleſiaſtique Countries, as Environed, and the Gulf of <hi>Venice</hi> in Jealouſie, by the Means of the Coaſts of <hi>Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples;</hi> He commanded <hi>Sienna, Porther cule,</hi> and ſome other places which h' held on that ſide, to be Fortifi'd, to bridle all <hi>Toſcany;</hi> He would have had <hi>Montferrat</hi> of the Duke of <hi>Mantoua,</hi> in exchange of <hi>Cremona,</hi> and tranſmitted it to the Duke of <hi>Savoy,</hi> with the Reſervation of <hi>Caſall, Trin, Mont calne,</hi> and <hi>Pontdeſture;</hi> To draw from him <hi>Vercel, Gallinare, Inree, St. Germacia, Mazin,</hi> and <hi>Creſcentine;</hi> H' intended to fortifie thoſe Ten places, ſo ſtrong, and to raiſe ſuch powerful Barriers againſt th' Irruptions of the <hi>French,</hi> that they ſhould for ever loſe th' hopes of forcing them, and of marching int' <hi>Italy,</hi> and th' <hi>Italians</hi> by conſequent the Will of calling them in, and ſolliciting of them t' an unprofitable Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tection, and impoſſible Defence.

                  <pb n="169" facs="tcp:33686:89"/>
                  <p> There remained alſo to Conſummate the Work, and to finiſh the Circumvallation, which had taken away from th' <hi>Italians</hi> all Hopes of Relief, and all Apparence of Reſurrection; but t'Invade the <hi>Vol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>toline,</hi> and to ceize upon that famous Gate, by which the <hi>Suiſſes,</hi> the <hi>Griſons,</hi> the <hi>Germans,</hi> and the <hi>French</hi> and enabled to deſcend int' <hi>Italy;</hi> but H' had Eyes only to Covet that Valley; And it had been then too Dangerous for Him t' have uſed force to Raviſh it; The <hi>Vene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tians</hi> alſo, whoſe Spirits were never more Warlike, nor Arms ſharper than at this Time, would never willingly have ſuffered ſuch an Uſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pation upon the Liberty of <hi>Italy,</hi> and ſuch a particular Block-Houſe againſt their Country of <hi>Ferme Land.</hi> Beſides the ſtrong Troops and Excellent Chiefs of War which they'd on Foot to fight th' Evil in its Spring, They'd as they've now a back-door open by Sea, and the facility of ſetting forth a Powerfull.

                  </p>
                  <p>But what moſt affrighted <hi>Charls,</hi> and Tempered moſt th' Heat wherewith He burned for the Conqueſt of the <hi>Voltoline,</hi> was th' In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſt which the <hi>Suiſses</hi> would make uſe of, t'hinder him, and with all their Forces t'oppoſe him. 'Tis certain, that there was not a Nati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on in <hi>Chriſtendome</hi> more Warlike and more to be feared than that of the <hi>Suiſses;</hi> The variety of Religions which hath ſince Traverſed them, did not weaken them in the Diviſion, and the Time which changeth and alters all the World, had abated nothing of their ſtrength, nor diminiſhed their accuſtomed valour. Theſe Conſidera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions ſuſpended for that time th'Emperors deſign, and made him re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolve t'attend till Time and Fortune made ſome occaſion t'appear more favourable for th' Execution. In the mean Time, by th'Even<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs and Beauty of the Platform, which h' had drawn to ſubdue <hi>Italy,</hi> may be ſeen, what a Great Maſter this Prince was in the Science of Conquering, and Ingeniere in the Work of Deſtroying and Foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding of Republiques. It may alſo be ſeen by the Succeſs, which be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fell him in that behalf, How God Confounded his Wiſdome, and laughed at his Projects; How He made them miſcarry, when they ſeemed to be the moſt Happily advanced, and neareſt to their Period, and how his Poſterity, which hath ſtuck to 't, have found the La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour of a Squibb, which ſcatters, as it is fired, and th'Exerciſe of <hi>Homers Penelope,</hi> whoſe Web untyed, as faſt as it was Woven to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether.</p>
                  <p>Let's return to th'occaſion, which <hi>Fortune</hi> made t' ariſe for <hi>Charls,</hi> and to the way it opened for him to paſs through int' <hi>Italy.</hi> That proceeded from the Quarrel, which kindled betwixt <hi>Francis</hi> the firſt and <hi>Sforces</hi> by reaſon of the State of <hi>Milan,</hi> whereof they were in poſſeſſion, and which <hi>Francis</hi> would Recover, as a Piece that did be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>long to him, and as a Member Dependent upon the Succeſſion which was fallen to him. It was not difficult for a Prince great in Virtue and Powers as <hi>Fancis</hi> was, to ſtrip Petty Princes, as the <hi>Sforces</hi> were, whilſt they were alone to reſiſt him, and ſole ſupporters
<pb n="170" facs="tcp:33686:90"/>of the Quarrel. But they ſtaid not long in that Poſture, and th' o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Princes of <hi>Italy</hi> ſuffered with too great Impatiency of Heart, and as in the Centre of their Countrey, a King of <hi>France,</hi> who be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides the pretenſions h'had t'other States there, had alſo, as they Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jectured, too great a power for ſmall Deſigns, and t' Ambitious a Soul to be their Neighbour only, to whom he might become a Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter. But all that was nothing to the Jealouſie <hi>Charls</hi> Conceived, and h' had there a ſtronger Intereſt than others, by reaſon of the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome of <hi>Naples;</hi> The poſſeſſion whereof being but ſtaggering, as of a Countrey newly Conquered, to which <hi>Francis</hi> had Right, and whoſe Inhabitants were naturally Lovers of Change, and greedy of No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>velty; That made him reſolve t' Aid th' <hi>Italians</hi> Deſign vigorouſly, and to Labour with all his Power the Re-eſtabliſhment of the <hi>Sforces.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>But He ſtaid not there, and He was ſo happy, That the <hi>French</hi> were not only driven from <hi>Milan,</hi> and that the <hi>Sforces</hi> re-entred it; but that the <hi>Sforces</hi> dying without Children, He retained it for Himſelf, or at leaſt Conferred it as Emperor, and as a Feif of th' Empire upon his Son <hi>Philip;</hi> And ſo th' <hi>Italian</hi> Princes had the good luck to gain their deſires in ſending us beyond the Mountains; but they had not all they aimed at, which was, that the State of <hi>Milan</hi> ſhould not depart from a Prince of their Countrey, and of <hi>Italian</hi> Birth. In that, Fortune ſupplanted their Providence; and in being delivered of a ſtranger, whoſe Neighbourhood was in Jealouſie with them, They had the diſpleaſure to ſee his place taken by another, who was not in leſs ſuſpition with them; or who knew better than the <hi>French</hi> to keep his Conqueſts, and gather the Fruits of his Victory, as <hi>Charls</hi> and his Succeſſors have done. 'Tis not here to be forgot, that after the Gain of the Battel of <hi>Pavia,</hi> and the taking of <hi>Francis,</hi> which were Acted in that War; Th' Emperor took off his Vizard, and declared himſelf publiquely for the deſign of the Chriſtian Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narchy; That hapned at the Conſultation made, whether he ſhould ſet <hi>Francis</hi> at Liberty, and whereupon the Duke of <hi>Alva</hi> gave his opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion boldly, That h' ought not to do it, and that the fatal Time was Come, wherein it was neceſſary to Collect the many different Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tries, which compoſe <hi>Chriſtendome,</hi> into one Body, and under one Head, t'oppoſe it entire and united againſt the <hi>Turks</hi> Empire, and th' <hi>Otto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons</hi> Greatneſs; as the ſole Means t' abate and deſtroy it. But in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſomuch that the ſtrongeſt Oppoſition, and the moſt Invincible Obſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cle, which th' Emperor had Encountred to his deſigns, came from <hi>France,</hi> and on what ſide ſoever He turned, H' alwaies found <hi>French</hi> Forces in his way, or th' Authority of this Crown; He reſolved to turn all his Arms againſt us, and to deſtroy the Foundation upon which the ſafety of <hi>Italy</hi> and of <hi>Germany</hi> was raiſed. But all theſe Aſſaults did but diſcover an Impotent Will of doing miſchief, and the various Expeditions he ſet a ſoot upon that occaſion on <hi>Picardy</hi> ſide, <hi>Cham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pagna</hi> and <hi>Provance,</hi> amounted at laſt to ſhamefull Retraits, or to
<pb n="171" facs="tcp:33686:90"/>great Loſſes of Armies. And what appeared moſt admirable, and made the Deceit of the Diſcourſes of Men the more Viſible, and the vanity of their Wiſdome, was, That th' Enterprize which <hi>Charls</hi> ſuppoſed to be the moſt certain and happy proved the moſt unhappy and Ruinous.</p>
                  <p>In the Journey He made to <hi>Provance,</hi> th' Expedition whereof I ſpeak, He came not, as to make a Conqueſt, but to take Poſſeſſion; And <hi>Antonio</hi> of <hi>Leve</hi> the firſt Author of the Deſign, diſſwaded it not, as Judging it Difficult, but as eſteeming it Infallible; And that his Maſter might have all the Fruits of the Succeſs, and all the Glory of the Deſign, <hi>Italy, Germany,</hi> and the <hi>Low-Countries</hi> were Infected with a certain Prophecie, which th' Emperor had cauſed to be ſcat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tered in thoſe Countreys; That <hi>France</hi> ought to change Maſter this year; And upon that Ridiculous Fear, and upon Hopes no leſs Ridi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culous, The Marquis of <hi>Saluſse</hi> General of the Kings Armies in <hi>Pied<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mont,</hi> quirted his ſervice, and by the Baſeſt and moſt Infamous Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, whereof Mention ever hath been made, became the Deſertour of th' Army he Commanded; As a Pilot, who gets out of his Ship at the firſt Noiſe of a Tempeſt. 'Twas then, that th' Emperor pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſhed it openly, and in th' Exceſs of his vanity, That the King of <hi>France</hi> ought to ſtrip him, or be ſtripped by him, And that the King of <hi>France</hi> ſhould become Emperor, and King of the <hi>Spaines,</hi> or that he would become King of <hi>France.</hi> That is to ſay, The Monarch of the Chriſtian Republique, by a neceſſary Conſequence. And yet the Succeſs gave the Lye to that fair Prophecie, <hi>Antonio de Leve</hi> paid with his Life, which he left in <hi>Provance,</hi> the Raſhneſs of his Counſel, and Novelty of his Diſſimulation. And th' Emperor had the ſhame with his <hi>Ferrant Gonſalve</hi> Marquis of <hi>Gast</hi> and Duke of <hi>Alva,</hi> To re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tire without doing any thing, but the loſs of thirty thouſand Men, in Taking what we did not defend, and in Entring of Places, which we had abandoned.</p>

                  <p>TH' Emperour having failed of his ſtroak upon <hi>Italy</hi> and <hi>France,</hi> applied himſelf to a Third Enterprize; And as they wh'Aſſault a place by a Quarter which they found ſtronger than they did Ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gine it, Change their Deſign, and Aſſault it another way, which they believe Weaker and leſs Defenſible; He reſolved to trye whether the wind would be more favourable unt' him, and the Conqueſt of <hi>Germany</hi> more eaſie. Two Heads ſhall here be propoſed to Conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deration, which may ſerve to whet th'Underſtanding, and open the Reaſonings of them, wh' are yet in th'Elements of Policy; And, if
<pb n="172" facs="tcp:33686:91"/>I may dare, to turn a word in ſome manner Sacred, t' an unſacred uſe, wh' are but <hi>Catechumenes</hi> in this Science; 'Tis for them alſo for whom alone I write. And I am not ſo vain as to pretend t' Inſtruct and Diſcipline them, wh' are actually Miniſters of State, but onely them who may be ſuch, and labour to ſtrengthen themſelves with neceſſary Experiments, and proper Diſpoſitions, to receive ſo noble a form. As t'others, by whoſe Conduct my Works are enriched, and my Diſcourſes draw ſpirits and life, I ſhould not be leſs ridi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culous, if I had undertaken it, than if the Stars, having Reaſon and Liberty, ſhould preſume to give a great Light to the Sun, from whom they receive all their Light, and all the Beams they ſend us.</p>
                  <p>The firſt Head then whereof I will ſpeak, is, what I have already diſcovered, of the Conſtitution th' Emperor found <hi>Germany</hi> in; That's to ſay, as a ſtrong and thick Body, which could not b' overthrown at once, but muſt be divided and put into parts, t' uſurp them all, in getting them by parts. The diviſion ought to b' in part a work of Fortune, and ſome effect of a Malign Planet to fall on that Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try, and partly a ſtroke of Human Induſtry, and the fruit of that Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon of State, which may be called, if you pleaſe, <hi>Prudence</hi> or <hi>Malice.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>As to the ſecond, 'tis certain, that <hi>Charls</hi> was a great worker of Diviſion, and a dextrous ſower of Diſcord; And 'tis certain alſo, that 'tis not uneaſie to ſow that Grain, and to make it fructifie where there are different Intereſts, and where many may pretend to the ſame things of Right of Conveniency. But for th' effecting of <hi>Charls</hi>'s great deſign in th' Uſurpation of all <hi>Germany,</hi> and of ſo many Soveraign Members that compoſe it, to make a Monarchical Body, A light and ſhort Diſcord was not ſufficient, or to divide it into parts, unleſs it were of Continuance, to prevent their Rejoyning; There ought to be ſomewhat of permanency and of duration; The Fire ought to be laſting and opiniated, and the Matter to maintain it ought to be combuſtible, but not periſhing; Otherwiſe ther's no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing more natural and ordinary, than that a general Intereſt, as of Liberty oppreſſed, rally them, whom a particular Intereſt had divided. And it hath been often ſeen, that the Conjunction of Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies hath reſtored Concords and good Intelligence in Armies, which before were but Partialities and Diſcords.</p>
                  <p>But Fortune did that in favour of <hi>Charls,</hi> which his Induſtry could not effect for his Intereſts, and kindled that durable and opiniated Fire in raiſing Hereſie, whereof h' had need, that cut all the Sinnes of the <hi>German</hi> Body, and broke for ever all th' Union of its Members. The buſineſs is but too well known and tried; That there's no ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject, wherein the Wills of Men are ſo Irreconcileable, as that where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in Mens Underſtandings have contrary Apprehenſions in Matters of Salvation, or Wounds ſo hard t' heal, as them which Hereſie makes in the Politique Body. Wherefore <hi>Charls</hi> connived at the Birth of <hi>Luther</hi>'s Hereſie, and choked it not when he might have done it: ſuppoſing, it may be, that He could when He pleaſed ſmother it.
<pb n="173" facs="tcp:33686:91"/>And having beaten his Enemies with that Flail, ſuppreſs them, and even by their Means whom He would beat. But He was deceived in both, and God did not permit that ſo ſubtil a poiſon as his, ſhould make his Operation, and ſo ſtudied a Miſchief b' happy. For that new Sect had ſo many wiſhes from the Princes; to whom they did abandon the Goods of the Church, which were yet in <hi>Germany;</hi> And ſo many Courteſies from the People, whom they freed from the va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious Mortifications of the Blood and Fleſh; That no Sect ever made ſo ſuddain a progreſs, or took ſo rapid or ſo impetuous a courſe; So that, whether th' Emperor had not then ſtrength enough to juſtle it, or that He would permit the Zeal to cool, wherewith all young Sects do burn, or that more preſſing occaſions did call him int' other places, as the defence of the State of <hi>Milan</hi> in <hi>Italy;</hi> He reſolved for ſome time not to diſturb the Religionaries of <hi>Germany,</hi> but to make uſe of th' Advantages, which the permiſſion of that Novelty might prepare for him, and to ſerve himſelf of the Demands, of the Threat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nings, and of the Forces of th'Innovators, for the Deſigns h' had in <hi>Italy,</hi> and in <hi>France,</hi> as it hath been repreſented.</p>
                  <p>But the Deſtiny of worldly things, and the Concatenation of th' Affairs of <hi>Europe,</hi> having ordained, that th' Attempts of <hi>Chals</hi> in <hi>Italy</hi> and in <hi>France,</hi> ſhould prove abortive and vain in both De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſigns; And having no hopes of acting any thing in thoſe places, where He was emptied of Invention and Forces, and where H' had loſt ſo much without the leaſt gain, as in <hi>France;</hi> and gained ſo little by his Labours and Conqueſts as h' had done in <hi>Italy;</hi> He reſolved t'apply himſelf to the Conqueſt of <hi>Germany,</hi> and to revive in good earneſt the Deſign, which till then h' had laid aſleep, for the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ducing it t' his obedience. For this purpoſe, and it ſhall be the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond Head whereof hath been ſpoken, the Conſiderations ſhall be made out which probably prevailed with him, and the Reaſonings whereupon He grounded his Reſolutions t'engage in that Enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prize, and hoiſe Sail, which was not at laſt propitious t' him.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Germany</hi> then torn in pieces by different Religions; And the Powers of Evil having been ſo efficacious, and its progreſs ſo active, that the number of the ſound were found much inferior to the ſick parts, and theſe more uncapable to return t' health by the proximity and influence of others, than they to be ſpoiled by the Contagion and Malignity of the firſt. And time, having opened the Proteſtants Eyes, and the various face of Affairs, by which th' Emperor had managed them, betwixt contrary Motions of Hope and Fear, of Promiſes and Threats, giving them cauſe t'underſtand, that his In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tention was never to make uſe of them, but as th' Inſtruments of his Deſigns, and Agents of his Paſſions to torment <hi>Italy,</hi> and give trouble to <hi>France;</hi> And wearied with ſo many Artifices, and ſo many Changes, and knowing <hi>Charls</hi>'s humour impatient of reſt, and his Spirit tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ported with a perpetual Ambition, and agitated with a continual Flux and Reflux of Turbuleht Projects, and Warlike Thoughts;
<pb n="174" facs="tcp:33686:92"/>Conſidering, that having ſtirred ſo much, and overthrown ſo much in other places, ſometimes with ſucceſs, and ſometimes unprofitably; And having caſt his laſt hooks, and employed his laſt ſtrength, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out taking or carrying away what he deſired; Making no queſtion, but at laſt would aſſault them, as a more probable and eaſie prize of prey; And as Victims ſacrifize them t' Ambition, th' Idol he did inwardly ſerve, under pretext of ſacrifizing them to the Religion he outwardly profeſſed; They did reſolve to think of their ſafety, and not onely by attending th' Evil to repel it, but t' advance for to fight him, and to be the firſt in the field, where they fore-ſaw th' Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ror would endeavour to be before them. For that purpoſe, they made a League at <hi>Smalchald,</hi> which had for principal foundation, the conſideration of giving a Coadjutor to <hi>Charls</hi> in th' Adminiſtra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of th' Empire, and to revive one of the Conſtitutions of the Golden Charter, which ſays, <hi>That to divert the Succeſſion of th' Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pire, there ought not to be three Emperors ſucceſſively of one Family.</hi> Th' Emperor, who knew, when there was occaſion, how to make uſe of force and ſubtilty, ſeeing that he could not Maſter the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſtants by ſurprize, as was his deſign, made no ſcruple in taking off his vizard, and in going boldly to them, as 'tis ſaid, with diſplayed Enſigns; To compaſs it the more eaſily, and to make the way to Victory the plainer, He practiſed a double Artifice, which at th' in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant proſpered and had a preſent effect, as h' had projected it; He made it to be reported at <hi>Rome,</hi> that he marched t' oppoſe th' He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſie, which exceſſively overflowed, and which had the deſign to paſs from <hi>Germany</hi> int' <hi>Italy,</hi> by the deſtruction of the true Religion, and upon the Catholiques heads; Nothing could more provoke the ſpirit of the <hi>Pope,</hi> and ſtir up his zeal to Religion, which in his per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon was aſſaulted; He knew well, that Hereſie knocks moſt particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larly at his dore, and that the firſt Groans and Attempts it had made upon its entry into the world, had been imployed againſt his Power; He conſidered, that the number of enemies was great, and appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hended the ſame fury, He did, when the Troops of <hi>Fuſtenberg</hi> marched to <hi>Rome,</hi> in the Name, and under th' Authority of <hi>Charls,</hi> a Catholique Prince, and was nevertheleſs but in his paſſage; H' had cauſe alſo to fear from them the conjunction of the duration to the violence, that came thither in their own name, and under th' Auſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tious Motives of Hereſie. Wherefore in th' Emperours favour h' opened the Treaſures of the <hi>Vatican,</hi> and them of the Caſtle of St. <hi>Ange;</hi> Accorded unt' him <hi>Croyſades</hi> and <hi>Tenths</hi> in all his Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tries, in th' Antient and New World; Commanded great and ſtrong Levies of Men of War to be made, which he ſent him, and procured him from all Quarters powerful Reliefs and conſiderable Subventions. Th' other Artifice was, Conſidering the great Col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lection of Men, which the Proteſtant Party of <hi>Germany</hi> raiſed, and other Northern Forces, which were of <hi>Smalchald</hi> League; That h' ought to labour the diminution of thoſe Powers, to deprive that
<pb n="175" facs="tcp:33686:92"/>League of the greateſt number he could of the Princes which were not yet engaged, and t' impede the greatning and ſwelling of that Torrent, by the concourſe and confluence of thoſe Waters that might run into 't; He knew the Nature of Leagues, and their Weakneſs; He knew, that they were made onely for Conſervation and Defence; That in them the moſt Ambitious and moſt Powerful made haſte t' Embark; So that they were the Men, wh' ought to ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther the principal fruits of the Victory, and allowing others a ſhare of the Conqueſt, keep to themſelves the moſt rich and fair things of the Body and Spoil; That the moſt Moderate and Weakeſt would engage ſlowly; Theſe, by reaſon of th' Accidents of War, which are always full of obſcurity and incertitude; And th' others, that if Fortune were contrary, and the Veſſel wherein they'd put them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves ſhould make wrack, they ſhould be the firſt to be carried away by th' ill ſucceſs, as having leaſt Means of reſiſtance, as to be the firſt drowned, as they wh' had on the ſudden neither Boat nor Plank to ſave themſelves.</p>
                  <p>And upon this foundation, and to give colour not t' enter into the League, to them who were not very deſirous of Emotion, nor ſo tranſported with hatred againſt him; As the Duke of <hi>Saxe,</hi> and the Lantgrave of <hi>Heſſe;</hi> He withdrew the cauſe of Religion, for which the coldeſt and moſt fearful are accuſtomed to take heat, and to grow bold, and the moſt wicked and the moſt prudent are aſham'd t'appear without Zeal and Violence; This obliged him to give it our in <hi>Germany,</hi> That his Arms were not raiſed againſt the new Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion, and Liberty of Conſciences; That his deſign was onely to ſuppreſs Rebellion, which being hatched in the Heads of the Duke of <hi>Saxe</hi> and of the Lantgrave of <hi>Heſſe,</hi> was diſcovered in th' Empire; That th' intention of thoſe Princes was not to defend or preſerve their Religion, which was neither aſſaulted nor threatned, but to ſuppreſs th' Houſe of <hi>Auſtria,</hi> whereof he was the Chief, and t' Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinguiſh or Appropriate to themſelves th' Empire, whereof his Houſe was the Guardian.</p>
                  <p>This pretext ſtriking at the root of Rebellion, He made no que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtion, but that it was leſs powerful than it would have been, if the Conſpirators could have covered their deſign with ſo ſpecious a ſail, as that of th' Honor of God, and that the wiſeſt and leaſt in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſſed of the Proteſtants could be content to ſee the firſt ſucceſſes of thoſe Arms, and on what ſide Victory would encline, knowing well, that if it favoured them of their Sect, they ſhould be always wel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come amongſt them, and that th' hands of the Society ſhould be alſo ſtretched out unto them; But if th' Heavens declared in favour of <hi>Charls,</hi> and that he triumphed over the Confederate Forces, They did conceive, that the Thunder prepared againſt Rebellion would fall onely on the Conquered wh' had rebelled, and that the vengeance would reſt upon the Borders of their Eſtates, wh' had not acted cri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minally, nor given Trouble, or excited Revolt. So that th' Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour
<pb n="176" facs="tcp:33686:93"/>held it for certain, That if nothing were ſtirred up againſt him but what appeared in <hi>Germany,</hi> he ſhould Eaſily overcome it; And that the great Forces he ſaw on foot, reſembled the waters of a Torrent, which deſcent with Pride, and over-flow with Noiſe and Spoil, but run not far, and whereof th' Impreſſions only are ſeen, and th' Evidences of their Violence. To theſe prudent Conſidera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, h' added them of particular Intereſt. To fortifie Virtue; and to Whet the point of it; He made great promiſes of Honour, and of Goods, to th' Ambitious and Covetous, who might b' uſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full to him; And with this Lure, he drew to his party the <hi>Duke Maurice</hi> of <hi>Saxe,</hi> To whom he promiſed th' Electorate, and the Lands of this Cozen, which are to this day in th' hands of th' heirs of his Brother <hi>Auguſtus.</hi> This Age hath brought forth ſomewhat like this, which ſhall be ſpoken of in the Third Part.</p>
                  <p>As to the Strangers, which the Proteſtants might Engage in their Quarrel, He knew well that there was none, but the <hi>French</hi> King, that could powerfully Aid them, and that could Contribute to ſo great an Expence, and to the Neceſſaries of a long War; That he alone could long Feed that great Monſter, which alwayes Eats without ever being Satisfied, and which wants alwayes ſome ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary Food, though there be all provided that Induſtry and Force can Contribute. But for this, he fore-ſaw, that the <hi>Germans</hi> being naturally Valiant and Feirce, and Nouriſhed in an Air like to that of the North, which puffeth up and ordinarily inſpires a good Opinion of themſelves, would move ſlowly to the poſture of Sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pliants, and publiſh to the World that they had need of Relief; That they would not demand it, till they ſaw themſelves Loſt, and would not repair to the Remedy, till th' Evil became Stronger than the Remedy, and that oppreſſed Nature had not Force nor Virtue to Support it; That it was the Cuſtom of Princes, whoſe Aid was Implored, to try firſt a Diverſion of th' Evil, and to Conjure down the Tempeſt which fell upon th' Heads of their Allies, by good Offices and Interceſſions, before any Force was raiſed; And by conſequent, That th' Overthrow might be given before any Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon could appear to Support, and the deadly Stroak before any Hands could be raiſed t' hold th' hands of them that Struck it; And 'tis the Nature of the Relief, which Princes give t' one Another, to prepare ſlowly, To ſend fewer than are neceſſary in th' Judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of them that ſeek it, and that they are rendred leſs in Number than they are intended by them that ſend them.</p>
                  <p>That this being common t' all States; In that time, it was par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticularly ſo to <hi>France,</hi> and that it often loſt its Charges and Loans for not Acting in Time, or not Sending of ſufficient Forces; As to this buſineſs, it did not reſolve t' Act Powerfully, nor to make any great Collection of Monies and Men in favour of the <hi>Germans,</hi> without knowing the Reaſons, under what Conditions, and what the Fruits ſhould be of ſo much Money and of ſo many Lives to
<pb n="177" facs="tcp:33686:93"/>be hazarded; That it would have ſome ſecurity for the Faith of them, with whom it was to make Society; As politique Prudence doth adviſe, and demanded places of ſurety for the Retrait of their Armies, and not to remain there the Prey of their Enemies, and the Laughing ſtock of Friends in caſe of Diſgrace; As the Maxims of War require, and other Conditions of a long Conteſt and diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cult Reſolution.</p>
                  <p>That it was the Cuſtom of the <hi>Germans</hi> of that Time, t' expect a freer Relief when they had need, than any people in the World; And when all that could be done, was done, to think, that enough had not been done for them, and that the Debt of doing more did remain on our ſcore; That it would Trouble them to reſolve upon giving places of ſurety for the Retrait of th' Armies, which ſhould March to relieve them; To Bridle themſelves by Voluntary Block<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>houſes, and to make Wounds in th' Empire which peradventure could never be healed; That if the Providence for the future, and the preſent Conſtitution required, that the <hi>French</hi> ſhould be Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>commodated with ſome place to ſecure their Return, when they ſhould b' Engaged in anothers Country, The <hi>Germans</hi> might have Jealouſie of their deſign, and fear leſt under an apparent Protection, the <hi>French</hi> ſhould introduce amongſt them a Viſible Uſurpation, and repel one Servitude in the precipitating of them into another; That ſuch an Apprehenſion would make them Agree without the <hi>French,</hi> when they might do it with an Advantage, and to Leave the <hi>French</hi> in the Dirt, when they had got out of it, and by th' Aid of them; That ſuch a Pretext would not be wanting to turn againſt their Liberators, and to paſs from the Defection t' Hoſtility, and of Unfaithfull Confederates to become Declared Enemies.</p>
                  <p>That <hi>France</hi> would make good Pawſes upon all this Matter, and deliberate long before it did Embarque in ſo high an Enterprize, and in ſo Jealous an Expedition; And by Conſequent, he pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſed himſelf t' have Diſſipated that great Body of Tumultuary Troops, which made the Proteſtants ſo Proud, and t' have Anni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hilated th' Enemies League, before it could find a forein Relief, or that <hi>France</hi> would ſtir in their Aid. This proſpered with him as he did Project it, and h' had then Finiſhed, what h' had happily be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gun, and which h' had above half done, if h' had not been hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred by the Cauſes which have been in other places reported. To this League another ſucceeded, under the Direction of th' <hi>Elector Maurice</hi> of <hi>Saxe;</hi> It was truly wiſer than the former, and th' Entery of <hi>Henry</hi> the ſecond into <hi>Germany,</hi> and th' Apparition of that new Star, which in ſome ſort might be ſaid t' have haſtned the ſetting of th' Emperour, and darkned his Light, gave them ſuch a Fright, that he ſought an Accommodation with the Proteſtants, and offered ſuch advantagious Conditions, provided they would quit the <hi>French</hi> protection, that they Accepted of them, and made their Peace at <hi>Paſſau,</hi> without Comprizing of the King of <hi>France,</hi> who did perſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nally
<pb n="178" facs="tcp:33686:94"/>aſſiſt them; They made it alſo without remembring the two Princes, whom they 'd given him for Hoſtages; And he reſtored them to their Liberty, with as high a generoſity, as the confidence h' had expreſſed unto them, In asking no other gages of their Faith, nor n'other earneſt of their Conſtancy. It had not been ſufficient for <hi>Maurice</hi> t' have Violated his Faith, and failed ſo Magnanimous a Protector; He who betrayed his own Blood, and made War t' his Cozen <hi>Frederick,</hi> to gain his Countries and <hi>Elector at</hi> Dignity from him, <note place="margin">In the year 1552.</note> If to Compleat his Baſeneſs, and Crown his Ingrati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude, H' had not <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>alſ' Accorded to th' Emperour that the Troops of the League ſhould march for his Service, and b' imployed againſt <hi>France,</hi> which had ſo much Contributed to make them Victorious, and to free <hi>Germany</hi> from Servitude.</p>
                  <p>The Pretext the <hi>Germans</hi> made uſe of, t' excuſe that foul pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding, and the Plaiſter they uſed to Cover that black Spot, was the Recovery of the City of <hi>Metts,</hi> which <hi>Henry</hi> the ſecond had taken in his March, with the Conſent of the Biſhop and People, who choſe rather to Live under the Government of a Juſt and Powerfull Monarch, as was <hi>Henry,</hi> than under the Tyranny and Weakneſs of many Maſters, as were the Majeſtrates who Governed it. The King having taken the Wind of th' Infidelity of <hi>Maurice,</hi> whoſe Intereſſed and Changeable humour was not unknown to him, and fore-ſeeing of future Tempeſts that might break upon <hi>France,</hi> believed that the leaſt he could do, was to Seize upon ſome Important place, to put a Bridle into th' Eaſineſs of the Confede<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rates Mouths, and t' hinder them from breaking, for fear of loſing that place; And in all Accidents, to Secure and Strengthen his Frontier at their Charges, for whoſe Security h' had hazarded his Country, and expoſed his Life, and the Lives of his Subjects ſo Liberally for their defence. That was but very Juſt, and therein nothing done but what the Right of Nature permitted, and the Law did Command. And truly, he that Remembers by what Title and Pretext th' Emperour did ſeize upon <hi>Cambray</hi> and <hi>Conſtance,</hi> which were Imperial Towns, and that it was done only to make <hi>Cambray</hi> a Rampar againſt <hi>France,</hi> and <hi>Conſtance</hi> a Bridle to curb the <hi>Suiſſes,</hi> would have Judged the King too delicate, and too weak, if upon better Foundations, and ſtronger Conſiderations, h' had made ſcruple to take Poſſeſſion of a City, whoſe greater part of Citizens did Invite him thither with earneſt Deſires, and to March within their Walls, after they had Lodged him in their Hearts and Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fections.</p>
                  <p>All the Forces then of th' Emperour were drawn towards <hi>Metts,</hi> the Rock, againſt which th' Emperours Fortune was broken, and where he began t' underſtand, that it was neceſſary for him to Leave the World, where he could not be, what he had been, and deſcend from the Theatre, where he could no longer appear but in the po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſture of an Unfortunate Prince, and as th' Example of Fortune.
<pb n="179" facs="tcp:33686:94"/>The March to <hi>Ranty</hi> finiſhed the Piece, and the fear h' had there to be taken, as infallibly h' had been by <hi>Sir</hi> of <hi>Guiſe,</hi> if one of the Commanders of the Kings Army had not cauſed the Retraict to be ſounded in th' heat of Fight, and confidence of the Victory; The fear, I ſay, which <hi>Charls</hi> had of that Accident, confirmed him in that noble and bold Reſolution, which h' had taken, to Leave the World, and to Renounce Ambition, th' Empire, and ſo great a Number of Kingdomes; He well ſaw, that by th' Experiences h' had made, and by the Diſgraces h' had received ſince th' Acceſs of <hi>Henry</hi> to the Crown, that the Genius of that Prince was Superiour t' his, and that h' ought not t' oppoſe his declining Age, and th' in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmities of old Age, to the growing Vigour of a flouriſhing Youth; He conſidered, that <hi>Henry</hi> was in Power t' affront him in War; That h' had alwaies th' Advantage of him in Negotiations and Treaties; That h' avoided the Nets were ſet for him at <hi>Rome,</hi> and in their Councils; And having diſſipated the Practices that were hatched there, to ſtirr up all the Catholique <hi>Chriſtendome</hi> a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt him, h' had the Dexterity to caſt the Proteſtant part of <hi>Ger<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>many</hi> on th' <hi>Emperours</hi> back.</p>
                  <p>Behold then <hi>Charls</hi> out of the World, wherein h' had made ſo much Noiſe, and diſordered ſo many things; behold his Monar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chical deſign fallen, and the three Countries in ſafety, any of which might have ſerved for a Plank, if h' had Conquered it, to paſs him to the Conqueſt of the reſt. But what is moſt conſiderable, and the greateſt Treachery that Fortune ever plaid him, Is, That while he Lived, he ſaw th' Empire transferred out of his Houſe, and to paſs into th' Houſe of his younger Brother; That he ſaw that Breach, and had not the Power to prevent it, and his Power and Credit unprofitably imployed to repair it. The <hi>Germans</hi> Inclination t' have no Emperour but of their Nation, and the Neceſſity h' had of them in the Wars h' had in hand, obliged him to Conſent, that his Bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ſhould be named King of the <hi>Romans;</hi> He did indeed conſent, Conceiving in time, either that <hi>Ferdinand</hi> ſhould give the Demiſſion in favour of his Son, or to cauſe his Son to be named King of the <hi>Romans,</hi> in quitting th' Empire to his Brother.</p>
                  <p>But <hi>Ferdinand,</hi> wh' had remembred all things that might raiſe him to that Dignity, and for that End, had been every Pliant to the <hi>Germans,</hi> even to the prejudice of his Conſcience, And who ſaw himſelf reproached at <hi>Rome,</hi> in the Perſon of his Ambaſſadors, That h' had made way to th' Empire by the diſdain of Religion, and by th' Injuries h' had permitted to be done him, would not willingly deveſt himſelf of a thing, which h' had ſo dearly bought, and h' had too much paſſion for his Son, to prefern his Nephew before him in th' higheſt Dignity of <hi>Chriſtendome.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Inſomuch, that th' Emperour having ſent before his Retreat, the Queen of <hi>Hungary</hi> his Siſter to <hi>Ferdinand,</hi> and <hi>Maximilian</hi> his Son, t' obtain either a Demiſſion of the Kingdome of the <hi>Romans,</hi> or a

But this hath not as yet hapned, and the ſame Providence, which to this Time hath not permitted Men to cut the Iſtmes and the Streights that ſever the Seas, which God would have divided, hath not permitted th' Advantages which one Nation hath upon another, to Conjoyn with duration under the Power of a ſingle Perſon; Though <hi>Philip</hi> ſet all ſorts of En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gines in Motion, and imployed all manner of Work-men, he could never make ſuch a Conjunction; And <hi>France</hi> could not become his Prey, though it was his Envy, and he could not Enjoy it, though he was paſſionately in Love with it; And having loſt great Forces, and thrown away many Millions amongſt us; having Traſſiqued much, and made much War in <hi>France,</hi> and ſtirred up the good and bad Religion t' attain his Ends; nothing remained of Conſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation t' him in the failer of the true matter of his Arms, and Practices imployed for th' uſurpation of the Crown, but the Beauty of the Pretext, by 'ndeavouring to give us a Catholique King.</p>
                  <p>For the Diverſion of the <hi>Reader,</hi> I will here obſerve, and for an illuſtrious Example of the Vanity of Greatneſs and Inſtability of human affairs; That 'tis hardly poſſible to find a Life more Inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>woven with good and bad, and more Embrodered with happy and unhappy Accidents, than the Life of <hi>Philip.</hi> 'Tis certain, that if he got much one way, he loſt much another way; And that if one part of his Deſigns hath proſpered, another part hath miſ-carried, and become abortive; Th' Accompliſhment of his Marriage with the Queen of <hi>England,</hi> which Encountred with ſo many Contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dictions and Difficulties; The Victories of St. <hi>Quentin,</hi> and of <hi>Graveline,</hi> whereof it hath been already ſpoken; The Re-eſtabliſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of the Duke of <hi>Savoy,</hi> ſtripped for th' Intereſts of his Houſe, and the <hi>French</hi> forced from <hi>Italy;</hi> ſo many Countries Conquered, and Mines diſcovered in the <hi>West-Indies;</hi> the Succeſſion of <hi>Por<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tugal</hi> with its Dependences, which he ſecured by his Arms againſt five famous Confederates; The ſuppreſſion of the Privileges and Liberty of th' <hi>Arragons;</hi> The defeat of the <hi>Mores;</hi> The gain of the Battail of <hi>Lepantha,</hi> wherein h' had ſo great a ſhare, and the Re-taking of <hi>Thumis</hi> and <hi>Gouletta,</hi> are indeed great Succeſſes, and will make a Noiſe to the Worlds End.</p>
                  <p>But on th' other ſide, the Death of the Queen of <hi>England</hi> with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out Children, and by Conſequent, the Poſſeſſion of that fair King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome
<pb n="182" facs="tcp:33686:96"/>Eclipſed; The loſs of the true Religion in the <hi>Low-Countreys,</hi> without preſerving, as our Kings have done, the faith and obedience due t' him; <hi>France</hi> delivered out of his hands, when he held it as taken; Th' Aſſault of <hi>Gelves,</hi> and the Landing of his Troops in <hi>Ireland,</hi> which were unhappy t'him; And th'Invincible Armado, that would have put <hi>England</hi> to the Chain, and for which the Rodomonts it carried, ſaid, That they deſired no more of God, than that he would not meedle in that Affair, and Leave them to themſelves; That Invin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cible, I ſay, Armado, that was but the ſport of a grain of wind, and th'Example of the greateſt Shipwrack that th' Ocean hath diſgraced ſince the time of <hi>Tiberius.</hi> In a word, of the three places, which his Father had recommended unt' him to keep with greateſt Care and Jealouſie, as the Key of <hi>Spain,</hi> of the <hi>Low-Countreys,</hi> and of <hi>Africa; Cadis</hi> was taken by th' <hi>Engliſh; Fluſhing</hi> by th' <hi>Hollanders;</hi> and the <hi>Goulete</hi> by <hi>Boſha Pialy.</hi> Theſe diſgraces nevertheleſs, and this variety of Accidents, took not from him that Reputation which hath flown through all the places of th'Earth, and which will be repeated in all th' Ages of the World, And as no wonder or new thing; ſince it hath been the deſtiny of the greateſt part of great perſons to b' expo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed to the flux and reflux of Fortune, and to dye rich in honour after many Loſſes. Though it was the Progreſs and Cataſtrophe of <hi>Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lips</hi> Life, He could not forbear to turn his Eyes towards the Monar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chy, and to caſt ſome Glances upon <hi>Germany</hi> the Seat of th' Empire, which is the Foundation and Centre; It was, it may be, to ſhew his Succeſſors the way they ought to follow t'attain it, and the ſtring by which they might recall and bring th' Empire to their Houſe; from thence proceeded th'Expedition of th' Admiral of <hi>Arragon</hi> beyond the <hi>Rhyne,</hi> whereof ſhall be fully ſpoken in the third part, in the Treaty of the Succeſſion of <hi>Cleves;</hi> from thence iſſued the Renewing of the ſame Enterprize by <hi>Spinola,</hi> under th' Archdukes of <hi>Flanders,</hi> and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der <hi>Philip</hi> the third; And though both of theſe Expeditions had a nearer End, which was the Communication of <hi>Germany</hi> and the <hi>Low-Countreys,</hi> and the Conveniency of making War with moſt Advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage to their Enemies, and to draw them into their Chanels and Ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers, yet the <hi>Spaniards,</hi> whoſe ſpirits are alwaies much vexed with fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture Conſiderations, and in all their Actions, have more than one mark to ſhoot at, beſides the Particular and preſent Deſign, had alſo in memory th' other General, and more forein deſign, t' open the way for themſelves to th'Empire, and to the Monarchy.</p>
                  <p>The Succeſſors of <hi>Philip</hi> did not ſuddenly caſt themſelves upon ſo vaſt Enterprizes, nor diſcover Deſigns that would much enlarge their Domination and Limits; And to the Time of the Kings Death, the <hi>Low-Countreys</hi> were the Field wherein they did moſt exerciſe their Armes, and where they've moſt appeared; Sometimes in the Qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity of Aſſaulters, and ſometimes in the Quality of Defendants. A little before, and preſently after the Death of that Prince, wh' of right was called the <hi>Great,</hi> and to whom amongſt all our Kings the Title
<pb n="183" facs="tcp:33686:96"/>of Incomparable was Juſtly due; if h' had not left a Succeſſor that did Equal him. The <hi>Spaniſh</hi> Armes raiſed Troubles, and occaſio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned ſome Innovation in <hi>Germany</hi> upon the Succeſſion of <hi>Cleves;</hi> But their Armes were Chiefly exerciſed in <hi>Piedmont</hi> againſt the Duke of <hi>Savoy,</hi> and they made their ſtrongeſt Aſſaults to ſtrip that Prince, and to Ceize upon th' Intermedium, which ſevers <hi>France</hi> from <hi>Italy;</hi> This bloudy Game wherein <hi>France</hi> Acted ſometimes with Faintings and Weakneſs, and ſometimes with Force, and with ſome ſtrains of Courage, continued to the Troubles of <hi>Bohemia,</hi> and to the laſt Emo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of <hi>Germany;</hi> Th'Empire alſo from <hi>Charls</hi> the fifths time to that time, had ſo much Changed from what it was, that nothing almoſt re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mained, but the Name and Armes, and inſtead of that proud and high flight, which their Eagles heretofore made and have ſince done, they did now beat only with one Wing.</p>
                  <p>But after that the Count <hi>Palatine</hi> had begun that famous Quarrel, which could not b' ended by the fighting of above fifteen Battels, and Angred them, whom ſince he could, neither overcome nor appeaſe; when he had taken <hi>Bohemia</hi> from th'Emperor, and carried the War into the Heart of <hi>Auſtria,</hi> and to the Suburbs of <hi>Vienna;</hi> The two <hi>Auſtrian</hi> Powers being United, had ſpeedily their Revenge of that Affront, and having changed the Courſe of th' Action, and turned their Defence into an Aſſault, thruſt out the Victory with<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">

                     </gap> great Advantage, that they were within little of the Compleating of it, in ſeeing it Crowned with th'Entire Conqueſt of <hi>Germany,</hi> That with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out doubt had hapned, if th' Impatient greedineſs of the <hi>Spaniards,</hi> as hath often been expreſſed, had not made them forget that old Max<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>im which was ſo familiar with them; <hi>Never t' undertake New Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quests, till the first had been well ſetled.</hi> And if the Countries of the Duke of <hi>Mantoua,</hi> which in apparance ought t' have changed their Maſter, Had not made them quit the Certainty, for th' Uncertain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, and t' Hazard what they Poſſeſſed in <hi>Germany,</hi> t' Uſurp what they could not take in <hi>Italy.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>But let's leave th' Affairs of the Duke of <hi>Mantoua</hi> to the third part, and take up the Deſigns of the Kings of <hi>Spain</hi> to cauſe th' Empire to return to their Houſe, and to put under the Wings of thoſe Eagles, what they had in their Poſſeſſion, and to Joyn, what they did not Poſſeſſe, and was neceſſary to make up the Wheel of their Monar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chy. They well ſaw, That after they were Poſſeſt of th' Avenues, and had Ceized upon the Borders of <hi>Germany,</hi> That if they advanced but ſlowly in that great and vaſt Countrey, The buſineſs would be too long, and that upon the way they ſhould meet with ſo many Rubs and Impediments, that they might peradventure be Conſtrain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to ſtay or retire. That did not divert them, from the project of In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vading the <hi>Voltoline</hi> for the Communication of <hi>Italy</hi> with <hi>Germany,</hi> and t'eſtabliſh themſelves beyond the <hi>Rhyne</hi> for the Comerce of <hi>Ger<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>many</hi> with the <hi>Low-Countries.</hi> As to the firſt, th' Inhabitants of the <hi>Voltoline,</hi> whom they'd long prepared to Revolt againſt the <hi>Gri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons,</hi>
                     <pb n="184" facs="tcp:33686:97"/>their Soveraigns, and the grain of Diſcord which they had there Sown and Husbanded with great Care, made them believe that they ſhould alwayes find the Door open there, when they'd a Mind t' en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, and that the pledges would remain in their hands during the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſtation of the Parties. As to the ſecond, the Death of the Duke of <hi>Cleves</hi> without Children, and the Concurrency of many Pretenders to that Rich Succeſſion, put it out of Queſtion, that if they did not poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſſe themſelves of all the Countrey, yet they ſhould gain ſome Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portant Member, and ſome Conſiderable peece. But their Provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence carried them further, and by an Intrigue Contrived with much Subtilty, and Cheriſhed with Conſtancy in the Family of the Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces of th'other Branch of their Houſe, They endeavoured to fix them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves in th'Heart of <hi>Germany</hi> to gain there great Countreys; To take away the great ſtone of ſcandal, and the fatal Obſtacle, which hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred them from Attaining th'Empire; Thay they were Strangers to th'Empire, and no Members of the <hi>German</hi> Body.</p>
                  <p>Two Principal Conſiderations gave them Courage to frame this Deſign, and to Contrive th' Intrigue; The firſt the Weakneſs th' Empire was fallen into ſince the Death of <hi>Charls</hi> the fifth, and th'uſe the preſent Emperors had of their Aid and Protection againſt the fervent Invaſions of the <hi>Turk,</hi> wherewith <hi>Hungary</hi> was much annoy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, and againſt th'Enterpriſes of Proteſtants, who were held at Bay, and hindred to ſtir for fear of their Powers; The ſecond Conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration was, th'Imbecillity of th' Underſtanding, and baſe Inclinations of th'Emperour <hi>Rodolphus,</hi> under whoſe Reign the Peace begins, which ſhall ſhortly beſet forth. His Brother <hi>Mathias</hi>'s humour being alwayes unquiet, and to whom Novelty, troubles and diſorders were vvonderfull Baits to carry him any vvhither; And th' humors of the tvvo younger Brothers, <hi>Maximilian</hi> and <hi>Albert,</hi> vvh' had neither Action nor Vigour, and vvere vvholly for Dependency in a Submiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion, and a blind obedience.</p>
                  <p>On th'other ſide, The Genius of <hi>Ferdinand</hi> th' Archduke of <hi>Grets</hi> their Cozen, and Brother in Law of <hi>Philip</hi> the third, bred to Devo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and by the Cuſtome of Dependency upon Spiritual Things, much diſpoſed to be Governed, and to permit Direction in Temporal Things; And no marvel, ſince it often happens that one of the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pendencies draws on th' other, as well on their part who ſubmit and follow, as of them who Govern and Conduct, and not being content with ſo abſolute and delicate a Domination, as that which is exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſed upon th'underſtanding, cannot forbear from enlarging of it upon material Objects; And if they make not firm and durable Uſurpati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons in that Province, to make there at leaſt from time to time, Ir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruptions and Incurſions; And in Relation to th' objects themſelves which are often much Complicated, and Mixed and Compoſed of what regards th' Underſtanding, and Concerns the Matter, and in which by Conſequent, their Princes have no leſs need of the Councel of Conſcience, than of Councel of State, and to b' enlightned with
<pb n="185" facs="tcp:33686:97"/>Lights of Chriſtian Morality, as with the Lights of Policy. So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>that though <hi>Ferdinand</hi> naturally loved Juſtice, and hated Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>probity, It was no difficult thing to perſwade him to Conſent to things, which juſtled Juſtice and Probity, in Colouring of them with th' Apparences of Religion, and in gilding them with the Pretext of the greateſt glory of God.</p>
                  <p>Beſides, That Prince had a Weakneſs, to which all of his diſpoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion are Subject, being of a benign Nature and ſweet Temper, not to reſiſt a long Importunity. The <hi>Spaniards</hi> eaſily foreſeeing, that Aſſaulting him in that place they ſhould gain divers things, to which H'had an Averſion, and Accord them, to Redeem himſelf from Vex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ation. And for to Compel him to yield, It was neceſſary only to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>double their batteries, and to ſummon him often to yield, which fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently hapned; As it alſo fell out, that in Conſideration of his zeal for Religion, of his Love for Juſtice and other good Qualities in that Prince, God ſent him proſperities, which had no mixture or proportion of Moral virtues; And for the puniſhment of his defects and weakneſſes, which he permitted to be th'Organs and Inſtruments of other Mens paſſions, he ſent him ſuch violent diſgraces, that he thrice ſaw himſelf within a little of being loſt without Remedy, and upon the brim of a Precipice from whence no perſon falling in, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covers himſelf; but at laſt good Succeſſes carried him over all diſgra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, and H' had this Satisfaction before Death, to ſee the Promoti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of his Son to the Kingdome of the <hi>Romans,</hi> though it was held un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lawfull, and the greatneſs of his Houſe in ſome ſafety, and in ſome good condition of Subſiſtence.</p>
                  <p>Let's Reſume, what we have quitted; <hi>Ferdinand</hi> had a Brother called <hi>Leopold,</hi> who was not truly a Prince of high Underſtanding, nor of great Ambition, nor Unfurniſht of Common Senſe and Martial Heat, and obliged to depend, as younger, on the Motions of his El<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der Brother. The <hi>Spaniards</hi> Judged alſo, That He would b' obli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged to depend on them, who gave the Law t' Actions, and to th'others Conduct, and that He might b' a proper Inſtrument t' advance the Deſigns they had on the <hi>Griſons</hi> Liberties, and for th' Uſurpations of the <hi>Voltolines.</hi>

An Agreement then was made in the Moneth of <hi>June,</hi> in the year 1608. by which it is ordained; <hi>That he deliver up to his Brother</hi> Mathias, <hi>the Crown of</hi> Hongary, <hi>the Scepter, the Royal Hat, and th' other Ornaments which were carried unto him by the Cardinal</hi> Dietreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thien; <hi>That he reſerved for himſelf the Title of that Kingdome, to bear it Joyntly with</hi> Mathias; As alſo he did relinquiſh unt' him the Lower and Higher <hi>Auſtria,</hi> whereof he retained only the Title, diſcharging th' Inhabitants of the Country from their Oath of Fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>delity, which they had Sworn unto him, and Conſents, that the ſaid <hi>Archduke</hi> ſhould be nominated Heir to the Crown of <hi>Bohemia,</hi> in Caſe he Died without Heir Male, and all this to be done without prejudice to the States of the Kingdome, in their Right of Election and other Privileges. The States of the ſaid Kingdome conſented to the ſaid future Succeſſion upon two Conditions, which were, That no prejudice ſhould be done to their Privileges, and that the ſaid <hi>Archduke,</hi> during the Life of his Imperial Majeſty, ſhould not in any ſort meddle with the Government of the ſaid Kingdome, nor with the Provinces Incorporated to it; And in Caſe he did, that he ſhould be deprived and forfeit the Right of Nomination, which was Accorded unto him, and that he ſhould Entitle himſelf only, the deſigned King of <hi>Bohemia, Rodolphus</hi> was not Entirely degra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded by this Treaty, nor the Liberty of the <hi>Bohemians</hi> wholly ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſed; There's alwaies a middle betwixt two Extremes, and ſome kind of diſtance to paſs from th' one to th' other. All the Wounds which are received, do not Kill a man ſuddenly, and the Vigour, which that people Expreſſed, and the Reſiſtance they made in th' Occaſion, ſecured to th' Emperour and them, the Remainder of Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty which appeared in that Treaty. The boldneſs of <hi>Mathias,</hi> and the practices of the <hi>Spaniards,</hi> ſtaid not there, and ſtopped nor in ſo fair a way. They had not begun ſo well without Reſolution to purſue it, nor ſo happily Entred upon their buſineſs without finiſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of it; The Dye was caſt, And it was an Inviolable deſtiny in their Judgment; t' Aboliſh the Right of Election in the States of <hi>Bohemia,</hi> and to make that Kingdome Succeſſive and Hereditary; For that purpoſe, it was thought neceſſary to vex the <hi>Bohemians;</hi>
                     <pb n="189" facs="tcp:33686:99"/>Their yoak was to be made heavier, and their Servitude larger. All obſtacles were to be broken, and all Gates opened that oppoſed that deſign. The Cardinal <hi>Cleſſel, Rodolphus</hi>'s Confident, and Governour of th' Affairs of <hi>Bohemia,</hi> made a great Oppoſition againſt them in the Councels, and feared not to reſiſt them publiquely, and break all their Stratagems; It was the Cauſe that <hi>Mathias</hi> at the ſuggeſtion of the Count of <hi>Ognate,</hi> the Catholique Kings Ambaſſadour, cauſed him to b' Impriſoned, unknown to th' Emperours and without any Conſent of the <hi>Nonce</hi> reſident in that Court; And thus having diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>armed <hi>Rodolphus</hi> of his faithfull and bold Miniſter of State, and taking down that head, which infuſed vigour and underſtanding into the <hi>Bohemians,</hi> he thought to reduce them eaſily to what they deſired.</p>
                  <p>After theſe Actions of <hi>Mathias</hi> above ſpoken of, and th'Innova<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions h' Introduced in th'Emperours Court; after h' had there done for a time all that he would do, and Governed at his pleaſure th'Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pire under the Name and Authority of his brother, He came at laſt to his deſire; but he was no ſooner ſetled in his Throne, whereunto the <hi>Spaniards</hi> had aided him t'aſcend, but they made him t' Adopt his Cozen <hi>Ferdinand,</hi> to th' Excluſion of <hi>Maximilian</hi> and <hi>Albert</hi> his Brothers, and declare him his Succeſſor t' <hi>Hungary, Bohemia,</hi> and th' Hereditary States.</p>
                  <p>This Declaration was not barren and vain, it was attended with its effect, as the Lightning is ſometimes with the Thunder; <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thias</hi> cauſed <hi>Ferdinand</hi> to come to <hi>Prague</hi> by deceit, and with Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny, but more effectively by the power of th' Army h' had in <hi>Bohemia;</hi> He compelled <hi>Ferdinand</hi> to Crown him King of <hi>Bohemia,</hi> leaving out the word of Election, and without any Apparence of th'Interven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the States Authority, which was the work the <hi>Spaniards</hi> aimed at, and for which they had long given themſelves much trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble; The Complement of the buſineſs, and the Concluſion of it was, <hi>That they made a Tranſaction with</hi> Ferdinand, <hi>by which it was reſolved,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">In the year 1617.</note> 
                     <hi>That th' Election of the Kingdoms of</hi> Hungary <hi>and of</hi> Bohemia <hi>ſhould b' aboliſhed, and that the King of</hi> Spain <hi>ſhould ſucceed to thoſe King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doms, in caſe of default of the strait Maſculine Line of</hi> Ferdinand; <hi>Provided, That the King of</hi> Spain <hi>ſhould relinquiſh all the Rights h' had in that Country in title of Granchild of th' Eldeſt of that Houſe.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Whereupon 'tis to b' obſerved, that all this was done and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluded betwixt the <hi>Spaniards</hi> and <hi>Ferdinand,</hi> with full Power, and pure Violence, and without the knowledge or participation of the States of thoſe Kingdoms, which are Elective; And it was th' occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of a great diſpleaſure conceived by the <hi>Bohemians,</hi> when it was made known to them, and the greatſtone of ſcandal, againſt which they ſtruck, and which carried them to the Reſolution they after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward took, to reject <hi>Ferdinand</hi> from being their King, and to call int' his place <hi>Frederick Gount Palatine,</hi> under whom was framed in <hi>Germany</hi> an Intricacy of Affairs, which five and twenty years of War could not diſſolve; And that a thouſand new Accidents, which
<pb n="190" facs="tcp:33686:100"/>every day ariſe, forbid the wiſeſt Men to diſcover th' Events, and the way to get out of that Labyrinth. That the Tranſaction was the principal and moſt violent Motive of th' Inſurrection of the <hi>Bohe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mians,</hi> appears by the Declaration of the States of <hi>Bohemia,</hi> upon the rejection of <hi>Ferdinand,</hi> of the 23<hi rend="sup">d</hi> of <hi>May</hi> 1618. by which they complained amongſt other things, That there was an endeavour to tranſport the Kingdom t' another Houſe; It appears by the Letter, which th' Elector <hi>Palatine</hi> wrote to th' Emperor the 25<hi rend="sup">th</hi> of <hi>June</hi> in the ſame year, wherein he ſays expreſly, That th' Authors of thoſe Troubles were Perſons, who ſought th' Improvement of ſome Fo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rein Greatneſs, and repreſents the Troubles which the Provinces of th' Empire would feel, if Strangers were Introduc'd, as had been done in the Dutchy of <hi>Juliers.</hi> It appears alſo by the Declaration made by the <hi>Bohemians</hi> in the year 1619. upon th' Election of <hi>Fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derick</hi> the Firſt, wherein they clearly ſaid, That <hi>Ferdinand</hi> endevour'd to tranſlate the Kingdom of <hi>Bohemia</hi> under a Forein Power.</p>
                  <p>But ſince there's nothing ſo eaſie as t' Accuſe and Diſguiſe an Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſation; That every Perſon flatters himſelf in his own Cauſe, which h' adjuſts and beautifies as he pleaſeth; And that the Paper receives what is imprinted upon it, as a Glaſs doth repreſent all that is ſet before it. Let's produce the teſtimony of <hi>Ferdinand,</hi> and the proofs h' hath furniſhed to the <hi>Bohemians</hi> Complaints; 'Tis certain, that his Predeceſſors ſpeaking of their States ever put this Expreſſion, <hi>of our Kingdomes and Hereditary Provinces;</hi> The word Hereditary Accompanying onely the Provinces and not the Kingdomes; He Tranſpoſed the word to the beginning of the Clauſe, that he might Fixe and Incorporate himſelf upon the Kingdomes as Provinces, and made it thus, <hi>of our Hereditary Kingdomes and Provinces;</hi> And in his Monitory Letters of the 30. <hi>April</hi> 1620. agaiſt th'Elector <hi>Palatin,</hi> by which he ſummons him to Leave in a Month, <hi>The Kingdome of</hi> Bohemia, <hi>and pretends that that Crown was fallen to him by Natural and Succeſſive Right.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>There was another Cauſe, which was doubtleſs known to the <hi>Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hemians,</hi> and obliged them to change their Maſter, and to ſeek ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther yoak than <hi>Ferdinands,</hi> whoſe perſon otherwiſe was not unaccep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table to them; 'Tis the ſtrong and Implacable Averſion that Prince had againſt Hereſies, and th'hot and burning zeal t'Exterminate them out of his Dominions, and in all places where his Authority was ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledged. At twenty years of Age, He made a vow t' our Lady of <hi>Loretta;</hi> He renewed it at th' Age of forty three, to our Lady of <hi>Celles,</hi> which is betwixt <hi>Auſtria</hi> and <hi>Styria,</hi> and Confirmed it a little before his Death by the Report of Father <hi>Lamorman</hi> in that Book of the Virtues of that Emperour. The Zeal truly of ſeeing the Ruine of Hereſies, and of placing living ſtones in the Temple of God, t' uſe the words of th'Apoſtle, is very Commendable in it ſelf, and t' have no ſense thereof is to be wholly deprived of Charity towards ones Neighbour, which is one of th'Ends of Chriſtianity; There muſt be
<pb n="191" facs="tcp:33686:100"/>a want of Piety to the Church, to which Heretiques make Wat; No Love for the Glory of God, which is Prophaned by Fable Worſhip. But though this Zeal may be as hot in th' Heart, as it ſhould be, and burn within; Though it may be much inflamed in it's Principle; yet it ought not t' appear but Tempered with Diſcretion, nor break out but by meaſure and Rule; thought not to procure its End but by con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venient means; by the waies which God hath ordained, or hath left to Prudence to make Choice of; Above all, he may b' aſſured that its Operations are ordinarily better effected by gentle and peaceable, than by violent and bloody hands. And ſuppoſe it to be an ill Inven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, to Kill inſtead of Healing, and to pull down an Edifice t'hinder the burning of it; That in Truth, there are Conſtitutions and En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counters, where ſtrong Remedies are to be uſed to ſtop the Conta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion of Diſeaſes which gathet, and where Houſes are broke down to prevent the fire, which they cannot put out from burning of others mens houſes, and conſume that which might have been preſerved. In this, I have given ſome Rules in the firſt part, and in ſeveral places, I ſay ſome what of it here and there, as conceive it neceſſary, and as th' Abuſes, which I ſee there Acted oblige me.</p>
                  <p>But tis Chiefly neceſſary, in kindling that Zeal in the Spirit of Princes, t' infuſe alſo convenient Lights for their Conduct. And what I have ſaid in other places ought to b' obſerved, and cannot too often be remembred, <hi>That great Perſons cannot commit ſmall faults, nor Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral Cauſes removed by ſmall Ruines. Sebaſtian,</hi> the laſt King but one of <hi>Portugal,</hi> before that Kingdome was ſubdued to the Power of <hi>Spain,</hi> is a very Remarkable Example of what I have now ſaid, The Queen <hi>Catherine</hi> his Mother having truſted his Education with Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gious perſons, honeſt Men indeed, and of Eminent Learning accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to their profeſſion, but unexperienced in th' Affairs of the World, and in the Science of Princes; Their greateſt care was, t' imprint deeply into the Soul of this Prince, naturally valiant, the deſire of making War to the <hi>Mahometans,</hi> and to Convert that great Principle of valour, wherewith he was born, to the Deſtruction of th'Infidels. This was truly very good, but the precepts were given him, and th' Impreſſion made without Diſcretion and Choice, without Modera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion and Rule, which ſpoyled the Goodneſs, and corrupted the Vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue of that Education; So the fruits, which it produced, were not be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neficial to Religion, though it was his Principal End, but fatal t'his Countrey, which changed its Government, and fell under a yoak, which it hath ſince born with much Impatience, and at laſt ſhaken off, after the loſſe of all patience. As to <hi>Ferdinands</hi> vows, which are much eſteemed by them, not to permit any Heretiques in the places of its Dominions, and to ſuppreſs the leaſt Impreſſions there of Hereſie; Not to ſpeak of the Nature of thoſe Actions, which may b'Excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent in themſelves, I find great Imprudence in the Solemnity, and in that Eminent condition of Acting them publiquely, and to the know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of many perſons. There are Actings indeed, which ought to
<pb n="192" facs="tcp:33686:101"/>b'Acted in the ſight of the World, and Expoſed t'high Noon, and put, t'uſe our Saviours Compariſon, in High places, as Cities built upon the Top of Mountains, that they may be the better ſeen, and that they, who ſhall ſee them, give God the Glory; And a Doctor that ſhall make a vow t' Apply himſelf wholly to the Combat of He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſies, and to purge the Spirits by his Doctrine of the venome, which is the more dangerous and mortal to them wh' are the leaſt ſenſible of it at their Deaths, might perform an Act of great value, and a thing in ſome ſort Heroique: But for a Soveraign Prince that would Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erciſe Proſcriptions and Puniſhments againſt that kind of Diſeaſes, not t' uſe greater Circumſpection and Secreſie than a particular per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, and to publiſh his Zeal and declare his Deſign by ſome publique formality, what other things is it, than t' adviſe his Enemies to b'up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on their Guards; Than t' awake them that ſleep, leſt they ſhould be ſurprized; Than to give them the Will and the Leaſure to put them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves into a poſture of defence; To ſeek Friends and Protectors; to Fortifie themſelves with Confaederations, And to Caſt them into Deſpair, which is more to be feared than Courage? This hapned to the <hi>Bohemians,</hi> and 'tis the ſecond ſpring of the <hi>German</hi> Troubles, which <hi>Ferdinand</hi> opened, and one of the principal Cauſes of th'Emo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions in <hi>Germany,</hi> which continue to this day.</p>
